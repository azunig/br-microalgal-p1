The net energy ratio (NER) for each process was calculated. The results showed that the use of horizontal tubular photobioreactors (PBRs) is not economically feasible ([NER] < 1) and that the estimated NERs for flat-plate PBRs and raceway ponds is >1. The NER for ponds and flat-plate PBRs could be raised to significantly higher values if the lipid content of the biomass were increased to 60% dw/cwd. Although neither system is currently competitive with petroleum, the threshold oil cost at which this would occur was also estimated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Lipid productivity and biofuel quality were the criteria for species selection. RESULTS: Chlorella vulgaris was found to be the best strain for use as a feedstock for biodiesel production and for this specie, a carbon dioxide sequestration rate of 17.8 mg L-1 min(-1), a biomass productivity of 20.1 mg L-1 h(-1), a lipid content of 27.0% and a lipid productivity of 5.3 mg L-1 h(-1) were obtained. Qualitative analysis of the fatty acid methyl esters demonstrates the predominance of saturated (43.5%) and monounsaturated (41.9%) fatty acids. The quality properties of the biodiesel were an ester content of 99.8%, a cetane number of 56.7| an iodine value of 65.0 g l(2) 100 g(-1)| a degree of unsaturation of 74.1% and a cold filter plugging point of 4.5 degrees C. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that among the fuel properties tested, the microalgal biodiesel complies with the US Standard (ASTM 6751), European Standard (EN 14214), Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP 255) and Australian Standard for biodiesel.

To this purpose, analysis of growth parameters, media of cultivation, biomass composition and productivity and nutrients balance were performed. Four microalgae suitable for mass cultivation were evaluated: Dunaliella tertiolecta SAD-13.86, Chlorella vulgaris LEB-104, Spirulina platensis LEB-52 and Bottyococcus braunii SAG-30.81. Global rates of carbon dioxide and oxygen were determinated by a system developed in our laboratory. B. braunii presented the highest CO2 fixation rate, followed by S. platensis, D. tertiolecta and C. vulgaris (496.98, 318.61, 272.4 and 251.64 mg L-1 day(-1), respectively). Carbon dioxide fixated was mainly used for microalgal biomass production. Nitrogen, phosphorus (calcium for D. tertiolecta), potassium and magnesium consumption rates (mg gX(-1)) were evaluated for the four microalgae. Biomass composition presented a predominance of proteins but also a high amount of lipids, especially in D. tertiolecta and B. braunii.

This work aimed to bioprospecting and screening 12 microalgae strains by applying, as selective criteria, the volumetric lipid productivity and the fatty acid profiles, used for estimating the biodiesel fuel properties. Volumetric lipid productivity varied among strains from 22.61 to 204.91 mg l(-1) day(-1). The highest lipid yields were observed for Chlorella (204.91 mg l(-1) day(1)) and Botryococcus strains (112.43 and 98.00 mg l(-1) day(-1) for Botryococcus braunii and Botryococcus terribilis, respectively). Cluster and principal components analysis analysis applied to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) profiles discriminated three different microalgae groups according to their potential for biodiesel production. Kirchneriella lunaris, Ankistrodesmus fusiformis, Chlamydocapsa bacillus, and Ankistrodesmus falcatus showed the highest levels of polyunsaturated FAME, which incurs in the production of biodiesels with the lowest (42.47-50.52) cetane number (CN), the highest (101.33-136.97) iodine values (IV), and the lowest oxidation stability. The higher levels of saturated FAME in the oils of Chlamydomonas sp. and Scenedesmus obliquus indicated them as source of biodiesel with higher oxidation stability, higher CN (63.63-64.94), and lower IV (27.34-35.28). The third group, except for the Trebouxyophyceae strains that appeared in isolation, are composed by microalgae that generate biodiesel of intermediate values for CN, IV, and oxidation stability, related to their levels of saturated and monosaturated lipids. Thus, in this research, FAME profiling suggested that the best approach for generating a microalgae-biodiesel of top quality is by mixing the oils of distinct cell cultures.;[Nascimento, Iracema Andrade| Izabel Marques, Sheyla Santa| Dominguez Cabanelas, Iago Teles| Pereira, Solange Andrade| Vich, Daniele Vital] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, BR-40170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil| [Druzian, Janice Isabel| de Souza, Carolina Oliveira] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Pharm, BR-40170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil| [de Carvalho, Gilson Correia] Univ Fed Bahia, Hlth Sci Inst, BR-40110100 Salvador, BA, Brazil| [Nascimento, Maurcio Andrade] Univ Fed Bahia, Polytech Inst, BR-40210630 Salvador, BA, Brazil;Nascimento, IA (corresponding author), Av Oceanica,2353-403 Ondina, BR-40170010 Salvador, BA, Brazil.;toiracema@gmail.com;de Carvalho, Gilson Correia/F-8051-2014| Nascimento, Iracema A/L-5069-2015| Souza, Carolina O/G-8869-2015| Vich, Daniele V/A-4515-2013| Druzian, Janice/G-6884-2015| Carvalho, Gilson/U-1770-2019;de Carvalho, Gilson Correia/0000-0003-1800-888X| Vich, Daniele V/0000-0002-9017-4228| Carvalho, Gilson/0000-0003-1800-888X| Oliveira de Souza, Carolina/0000-0002-8028-5418| Druzian, Janice Izabel/0000-0001-8940-6098;National Council for the Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ)/Science and Technology Ministry, Brazil [574712/2008-9, 551134/2010-0];This work benefited from the support from the National Council for the Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ)/Science and Technology Ministry, Brazil (processes 574712/2008-9 and 551134/2010-0).;;62;225;228;9;288;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1939-1234;1939-1242;;BIOENERG RES;BioEnergy Res.;MAR;2013;6;1;;;;;1;13;;10.1007/s12155-012-9222-2;;;13;Energy & Fuels| Environmental Sciences;Energy & Fuels| Environmental Sciences & Ecology;084EA;WOS:000314518300001;;;;;2021-01-01

Microalgae can reduce CO2 emissions from thermoelectric power plants, but for this use, they must be resistant to the mixture of gases produced by the power plants. We isolated the microalgae Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella kessleri from the waste treatment ponds of the Presidente Medici coal fired thermoelectric power plant in the Southernmost Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul and investigated their growth characteristics when exposed to different concentrations of CO2. When cultivated with 6% and 12% CO2, C. kessleri showed a high maximum specific growth rate (lambda(max)) of 0.267/day, with a maximum biomass productivity (P-max) of 0.087 g/L/day at 6% CO2. For S. obliquus, the highest maximum dry weight biomass value was 1.14 g/L with 12% CO2. We also found that these two microalgae also grew well when the culture medium contained up to 18% CO2, indicating that they have potential for biofixation of CO2 in thermoelectric power plants.

As a consequence, protein N (PN) to total N (TN) ratio may be variable in microalgae grown in batch cultures, and this may limit the usefulness of the nitrogen-to-protein conversion factors (N-Prot factors), the most practical way of determining protein content. The accuracy of protein determination by this method depends on the establishment of specific N-Prot factors, and experimental data are needed to fill this gap. Complementing a previous study, the present work was designed to quantify the fluctuations of the main nitrogenous compounds during the growth of 12 species of marine microalgae, as well as to determine N-Prot factors for them. The microalgae were cultured in two experimental conditions: (a) using a N-replete culture medium (initial N concentration, 1.18 mM) and aeration, and (b) with a N-depleted culture medium (initial N concentration, 235 muM) and no aeration. The distribution of intracellular nitrogen was studied by constructing budgets of different nitrogen pools in different growth phases of the cultures. In all species, large variations occurred in the distribution of PN and non-protein N (NPN) in the treatments tested and in different growth phases. Intracellular inorganic nitrogen (NO3- NO2- and NH3 + NH4+) was the most important NPN component (0.4- 30.4% of TN) in all species, followed by nucleic acids (0.3 -12.2% of TN), and chlorophylls (0.1 - 1.8% of TN). The relative importance of NPN was greater in the exponential phase, decreasing during growth. PN ranged from 59.3 to 96.8% of TN. N-Prot factors are proposed for each of the species studied, based on the ratio of amino acid residues to TN, with values ranging from 2.53 to 5.77. Based on current results and on the previous study, we establish an overall average N-Prot factor for all species, treatments and growth phases of 4.78 +/- 0.62 (n = 354). This study confirms that the use of the traditional factor 6.25 is unsuitable for marine microalgae, and the use of the N-Prot factors proposed here is recommended.;Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Biol Marinha, BR-24001970 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil| Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Ciencias Farmaceut, Dept Alimentos & Nutr Expt, BR-05315970 Sao Paulo, Brazil| Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Oceanol, Dept Oceanog Biol, BR-05315970 Sao Paulo, Brazil;Lourenco, SO (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Biol Marinha, Caixa Postal 100644, BR-24001970 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.;solourenco@yahoo.com;Lavin, Paris/AAI-9053-2020;Lavin, Paris/0000-0002-8893-526X;;;;47;200;204;1;55;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0967-0262;1469-4433;;EUR J PHYCOL;Eur.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of a Spirulina extract. The antioxidant activity of a methanolic extract of Spirulina was determined in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro antioxidant capacity was tested on a brain homogenate incubated with and without the extract at 37 degrees C. The IC50 (concentration which causes a 50% reduction of oxidation) of the extract in this system was 0.18 mg/ml. The in vivo antioxidant capacity was evaluated in plasma and liver of animals receiving a daily dose of 5 mg for 2 and 7 weeks. Plasma antioxidant capacity was measured in brain homogenate incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees C, The production of oxidized compounds in liver after 2 h of incubation at 37 degrees C was measured in terms of thiobarbituric acid reactant substances (TBARS) in control and experimental groups. Upon treatment, the antioxidant capacity of plasma was 71% for the experimental group and 54% for the control group. Data from liver spontaneous peroxidation studies were not significantly different between groups. The amounts of phenolic acids, alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene were determined in Spirulina extracts.

The different extraction procedures (exposure to water, grinding, etc.), protein precipitation using different amounts of 25% trichloroacetic acid and quantification of protein by two different methods and using two protein standards were evaluated. All procedures were tested using freeze-dried samples of three macroalgae: Porphyra acanthophora var. acanthophora, Sargassum vulgare and Ulva fasciata. Based on these results, a protocol for protein extraction was developed, involving the immersion of samples in 4.0 mL ultra-pure water for 12 h, followed by complete grinding of the samples with a Potter homogeniser. The precipitation of protein should be done with 2.5:1 25% TCA:homogenate (v/v). The protocol for extraction and precipitation of protein developed in this study was tested with other macroalgae (Aglaothamnion uruguayense, Caulerpa fastigiata, Chnoospora minima, Codium decorticatum, Dictyota menstrualis, Padina gymnospora and Pterocladiella capillacea) and microalgae (Amphidinium carterae, Dunaliella tertiolecta, Hillea sp., Isochrysis galbana and Skeletonema costatum). Comparison with the actual protein content determined from the sum of amino acid residues, suggests that Lowry's method should be used instead of Bradford's using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as protein standard instead of casein. This may be related to the reactivity of the protein standards and the greater similarity in the amino acid composition of BSA and algae. The current results should contribute to more accurate protein determinations in marine algae.;Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Biol Marinha, BR-24001970 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil| Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Biotecnol Vegetal, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil;Lourenco, SO (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Biol Marinha, Caixa Postal 100644, BR-24001970 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.;solourenco@yahoo.com;;;;;;43;165;173;7;190;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0921-8971;1573-5176;;J APPL PHYCOL;J.

The light cycles evaluated were 0:24, 2:22, 4:20. 6:18, 8:16, 10:14, 12:12, 14:10, 16:8, 18:6, 20:4, 22:2 and 24:0 (night:day), respectively. The results obtained indicated that the duration of the light periods was a determinant factor in the performance of the photobioreactors. A linear reduction in biomass production and carbon dioxide fixation with reductions in the duration of the light period was evident, with the exception of the 12:12 (night:day) cycles. Reductions of up to 99.69% in the carbon-fixation rates as compared with cultures under continuous illumination were obtained. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty strains were tested for their growth capacity: the growth parameters of 13 strains were determined, and the following three strains were selected and cultivated in photobioreactors: the isolated and unknown LEM-IM 11, Botryococcus braunii and Chlorella vulgaris. The capacity of each strain to remove nitrogen and phosphorus as well its growth rate and biomass composition was determined. B. braunii LEM 14 showed the best combined results and is a good candidate for the development of a large-scale process. From the treated domestic wastewater, 79.63% of the nitrogen and phosphorus was removed after 14 days of culture at 25 degrees C. Biomass composition indicated an oil accumulation (36% dry weight) and high carbon uptake (144.91 mg(CO2) g(biomass)(-1) L-1 day(-1)). Fatty acid methyl ester analysis showed a predominance of palmitic (C16:0) and oleic (C18:1) acids, with considerable amounts of stearic (C18:0), linoleic (C18:2) and alpha-linolenic (C18:3) acids.

The batch adsorption system was evaluated in relation to the initial pH, contact time, initial dye concentration and temperature. An alternative kinetic model (general order kinetic model) was compared with the traditional pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic models. The equilibrium data were fitted to the Langmuir. Freundlich and Liu isotherm models, and the thermodynamic parameters were also estimated. Finally, the adsorbents were employed to treat a simulated dye-house effluent. The general order kinetic model was more appropriate to explain RR-120 adsorption by SP and AC. The equilibrium data were best fitted to the Liu isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacities of RR-120 dye were found at pH 2 and 298 K, and the values were 482.2 and 267.2 mg g(-1) for the SP and AC adsorbents, respectively. The thermodynamic study showed that the adsorption was exothermic, spontaneous and favourable. The SP and AC adsorbents presented good performance for the treatment of simulated industrial textile effluents, removing 94.4-99.0% and 93.6-97.7%, respectively, of the dye mixtures containing high saline concentrations.

A successful and economically viable algae based oil industry will depend on the selection of appropriate microalgal strains and the selection of the most suitable lipid extraction method. In this paper, five extraction methods were evaluated regarding the extraction of lipids from Chlorella vulgaris: Bligh and Dyer, Chen, Folch, Hara and Radin, and Soxhlet. Furthermore, the addition of silica powder was studied to evaluate the introduction of more shear stress to the system as to increase the disruption of cell walls. Among the studied methods, the Bligh and Dyer method assisted by ultrasound resulted in the highest extraction of oil from C. vulgaris (52.5% w/w). Addition of powder silica did not improve the extraction of oil. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;[Matos, Leonardo J. B. L.| Fernandes, Jader O.| Cartaxo, Samuel J.

First-generation biofuels were derived from crops such as sugar cane, corn and soybean, which contribute to water scarcity and deforestation. Second-generation biofuels originated from lignocellulose agriculture and forest residues, however these needed large areas of land that could be used for food production. Based on technology projections, the third generation of biofuels will be derived from microalgae. Microalgae are considered to be an alternative energy source without the drawbacks of the first- and second-generation biofuels. Depending upon the growing conditions, microalgae can produce biocompounds that are easily converted into biofuels. The biofuels from microalgae are an alternative that can keep the development of human activity in harmony with the environment. This study aimed to present the main biofuels that can be derived from microalgae. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this work is to test and compare the performance of Chlorella vulgaris on several streams from five stages, from two different WWTP. The results showed biomass yields ranging from 39 to 195 mg dry-weight l(-1) days(-1). The best performance as biomass production was obtained with the centrate (effluent from drying the anaerobic sludge). After testing a wide range of NIP ratios with centrate, the highest productivity and growth rates were obtained with the original N/P ratio (2.0) of this stream. The highest removal rates were of 9.8 (N) and 3.0 (P) mg l(-1) - days(-1), in the centrate. Finally, this research also suggests that microalgal production seems to be a promising process when coupled to wastewater treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The survey was carried under different conditions seeking comparative assessment of extraction methods. The method using chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) showed the highest lipid extraction followed by methanol, chloroform, ethanol, and hexane. Afterward, we also assessed the relative influence of the solvent extractor selectivity on the overall FAMEs (Fatty Acids Methyl Esters) yield. The application of the transesterification process on the several lipidic extracts was compared with direct transesterification process from thy biomass. In the extraction using chloroform:methanol system a larger amount of lipids was obtained but the conversion to FAMEs using transesterification process was the lowest from lipids. However, despite the amount of extracted lipids with methanol being smaller, its conversion to FAMEs was higher from lipids. In addition, the extraction with methanol followed by transesterification process also resulted in a higher FAMEs yield from biomass than direct transesterification process using methanol.

This microorganism grows photosynthetically but an organic substrate can stimulate its growth. Molasses is a by-product from sugar industry, containing more than 50% of sugar, and potentially useful as substrate to microalgae culture. On the other hand, light is needed to the photosynthetic fixation of CO2. So, we determined the effects of molasses concentration and light levels on mixotrophic biomass production by Spirulina platensis. Molasses concentration was the main factor influencing maximum biomass concentration (X-max, g L-1) and maximum specific growth rate (mu(max), d(-1)), although light intensity also influenced both parameters after 11 days. X-max reached 2.94 g L-1 and mu(max) 0.147 d(-1) while the average maximum productivity (P-max, g L-1 d(-1)) of 0.32 g L-1 d(-1) occurred within the first few days and was not significantly affected either by the molasses concentration or light. Biomass production was stimulated by molasses, suggesting that this industrial by-product could be used as a low-cost supplement for the growth of Spirulina platensis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The accuracy of protein determination depends on the establishment of specific N-Prot factors, since the conventional factor of 6.25 may be unsuitable for all species. This study was designed to determine the concentrations of the main nitrogenous compounds and to establish N-Prot factors specific for the following marine microalgae: Chlorella minutissima, Dunaliella tertiolecta, Hillea sp., Isochrysis galbana, Nannochloropsis oculata, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Prorocentrum minimum, Skeletonema costatum, Synechococcus subsalsus, and Tetraselmis gracilis. Cultures were maintained under a 12-h photoperiod (300 mu mol photons.m(-2).s(-1)) at temperatures of 20.0 degrees +/- 1.0 degrees C (dark) to 23.0 degrees +/- 2.0 degrees C (light) in Walne's culture medium without additional external carbon sources. The distribution of intracellular nitrogen was studied by determining total nitrogen (TN, by CMV [carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen] analysis), protein N (PN, by analysis of total amino acids), and nonprotein N (NPN, determined by analysis of DNA, RNA, chlorophylls (chl) a, b, and c, and intracellular inorganic nitrogen-NO3-, NO2-, and NH3 + NH4+) in logarithmic and stationary growth phases of cultures. Variations occurred in both accumulation and distribution of PN and NPN among the species, as well as in each species during the different growth phases. Inorganic nitrogen compounds were observed to be the most important NPN source (from 6.4 +/- 0.1% to 41.8 +/- 4.2% of total N) in all species (except D. tertiolecta), followed by nucleic acids (from 0.8 +/- 0.1% to 26.1 +/- 2.4% of TN) and chlorophylls (from 0.2 +/- 0.0% to 3.1 +/- 0.3% of TN). Total amino acid residues ranged from 63.1 +/- 4.6% up to 88.1 +/- 11.2% of TN, which is in agreement with the presence of high NPN concentrations. N-Prot factors are proposed for each growth phase in tice studied species, based on the ratio of amino acid residues to TN, establishing specific N-prot factors ranging from 3.60 +/- 0.27 to 4.99 +/- 0.64. The mean N-Prot factor for all species/growth phases was 4.58 +/- 0.11. The present study shows that the use of the traditional factor 6.25 is not suitable for these marine microalgae, and possibly for other species, because it overestimates their actual protein content.;Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, CCS, Inst Biol, Dept Bot, BR-21941900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil| Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Food & Expt Nutr, BR-05315970 Sao Paulo, Brazil| Univ Sao Paulo, Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol Oceanog, BR-05315970 Sao Paulo, Brazil;Lourenco, SO (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, CCS, Inst Biol, Dept Bot, Ilha Fundao, BR-21941900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;lourenco@usp.br;Marquez, Ursula M L/I-4064-2013;;;;;55;105;111;1;50;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-3646;1529-8817;;J PHYCOL;J.

Evidence is building that this may also be the case for streams, especially those in the tropics. At the level of individual consumer species we also see that the apparent diet may not be reflected in the carbon assimilated. Tropical streams commonly have omnivore-detritivore species that potentially show this phenomenon. We tested these concepts in four moderately shaded sites in a stream in well-preserved Atlantic rainforest at Ilha Grande, Rio de Janeiro. We sampled aquatic insects, shrimps and fish as well as potential terrestrial and aquatic primary food sources. Carbon stocks from terrestrial sources predominated over carbon of algal origin (> 99% of total). The primary sources of carbon showed distinctly different isotopic signatures: terrestrial sources had delta C-13 values close to -30 parts per thousand, microalgae were -20 parts per thousand and macroalgae were -25 parts per thousand. All fauna had delta C-13 values consistent with a carbon source derived from microalgae. Baetid mayflies and atyid shrimps exert a strong grazing pressure on periphyton and organic sediments but appear to assimilate predominantly microalgae. The palaemonid shrimp Macrobrachium olfersi also ingests large amounts of detritus of terrestrial origin, but apparently assimilates animal prey with algal delta C-13 signatures. These results support the growing view that tropical stream food chains are primarily algal based.;Unif Edtado Rio de Janeiro, IBRAG, Dept Ecol, BR-20550013 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil;Moulton, TP (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Fac Environm Sci, Ctr Riverine Landscapes, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.;moulton@uerj.br;Bunn, Stuart E/B-9065-2008| Moulton, Timothy P/B-4147-2013;Bunn, Stuart E/0000-0002-6540-3586| Moulton, Timothy P/0000-0001-8223-2582;;;;63;95;98;2;51;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1442-9985;1442-9993;;AUSTRAL ECOL;Austral Ecol.;AUG;2006;31;5;;;;;623;633;;10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01610.x;;;11;Ecology;Environmental Sciences & Ecology;064TQ;WOS:000239112400009;;Green Published;;;2021-01-01

Cells were grown in batch cultures (f/2 medium, salinity of 28, temperature of 20 degrees C, light intensity of 40 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and 12/12 h L/D photoperiod) and concentrated using sodium hydroxide (control), sodium hydroxide and the anionic polyacrylamide flocculant Magnafloc (R) LT-25 (APF treatment) and sodium hydroxide plus the cationic polyacrylamide flocculant Flopam (R) (CPF treatment). There were no statistically significant differences among treatments with respect to lipid extraction for both species. However, N. oculata which presented higher percentages of C16:0, C16:1 and C20:5 fatty acids showed an increase of C14:0 and a decrease of C20:5 with the use of anionic flocculant. Additionally, T. weissflogii which had high percentages of C16:0, C16:1, C16:3 and C20:5, showed a decrease of C18:0 and C18:1n9c when both flocculants were used and a small decrease of C16:0 in the APF treatment. The results indicate that the choice of flocculant should be based on the level of saturation desirable, i.e., if the goal is to produce more stable biodiesel, with low percentage unsaturated fatty acids, then anionic flocculants should be used. On the other hand, if the aim is to produce unsaturated fatty acids for commercial uses in the pharmacy or food industries, then anionic polymers should be avoided. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Repeated batch cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms is widely used industrially because it allows actively growing cultures to be maintained for long periods of time. Despite this, there have been few detailed studies involving the repeated batch cultivation of S. platensis. We used a Box-Behnken factorial design to optimize the repeated batch cultivation of S. platensis in open raceway ponds at 30 degrees C under a light intensity of 3000 1x and a 12 h photoperiod for a total cultivation time of 1500 h (60 days) where the variables were blend concentration (0.40, 0.60 and 0.80 g l(-1)), renewal rate (20, 40 and 60%) and culture medium, the culture media being Zarrouk medium in three different dilutions. We found that S. platensis productivity was 0.028 to 0.046 g l(-1) day(-1) and the maximum specific growth rate (u(max)) 0.038 to 0. 138 day(-1), all the process variables being statistically significant at p<0.05. Our results show that semicontinuous cultivation of S. platensis can be optimized using a medium consisting of 20% (v/v) Zarrouk Medium, a S. platensis blend concentration of 0.40 9 l(-1) and a renewal rate of between 40 and 60%.

The influence of the external liquid recirculation/biogas ratio (0.5 < L/G < 67) on the removal of CO2 and H2S, and on the concentrations of O-2 and N-2 in the upgraded biogas, was also evaluated. A L/G ratio of 10 was considered optimum to support CO2 and H2S removals of 80% and 100%, respectively, at all biogas flow rates tested. Biomass productivity increased at increasing biogas flow rate, with a maximum of 12 +/- 1 g m(-2) d(-1) at 1.2 m(3) m(-2) h(-1), while the C, N, and P biomass content remained constant at 49 +/- 2%, 9 +/- 0%, and 1 +/- 0%, respectively, over the 175 days of experimentation.

The algae were grown in Walne's medium and supplied with nitrate, ammonium or urea as a nitrogen (N) source at a high concentration (1.18 mM). Growth was monitored by daily cell counts. and samples for biochemical analysis were taken near the end of the exponential growth phase. when N nutrient and phosphate still remained in the medium. Two species. Hillea sp. and Prorocentrum minimum, failed to grow with ammonium-N because of the toxic effect of ammonia in high concentration. Hillea sp. and Nannochloropsis oculata on urea-N, and Isochrysis galbana, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Synechococcus subsalsus on ammoniumn-N, showed significantly lower final yield than with the other-N sources. Greater percentages of protein and chlorophyll (dry matter) occurred in the treatment (N source) that produced higher final cell yield. Treatments producing lower final yields tended to give a larger relative content of carbohydrate and lipid in the Cells, and in some cases greater cellular volumes. Seven species tended to produce lower percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) with urea-N. Hillea sp., a microalga not yet used in aquaculture. seems to be a promising food-species because of its fast growth rate with nitrate-N and its large relative content of protein and lipids, and because it produces all essential FAs. Differences in chemical profiles resulted from the use of different nitrogen Sources in most cases. but few general trends were identified, even within the same taxonmic group (diatoms, green algae).;Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Biol Marinha, BR-24001970 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil| Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Ciencias Farmaceut, Dept Alimentos & Nutr Expt, BR-05315970 Sao Paulo, Brazil| Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Oceanog, Dept Oceanog Biol, BR-05315970 Sao Paulo, Brazil;Lourenco, SO (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Biol Marinha, Caixa Postal 100644, BR-24001970 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.;solourenco@yahoo.com;Mancini-Filho, Jorge/F-3950-2018;;;;;45;80;91;2;95;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0031-8884;2330-2968;;PHYCOLOGIA;Phycologia;MAR;2002;41;2;;;;;158;168;;10.2216/i0031-8884-41-2-158.1;;;11;Plant Sciences| Marine & Freshwater Biology;Plant Sciences| Marine & Freshwater Biology;558DL;WOS:000175950900007;;;;;2021-01-01

The liquid products were characterized, and the effects of temperature and catalyst: biomass ratio were analyzed. For Chlorella sp., a temperature of 550 degrees C, with no catalyst were the optimal conditions, resulting in a maximum bio-oil yield of 57 wt.%. For Nannochloropsis, a temperature of 500 degrees C, with 0.5 of catalyst ratio were shown to be the optimal condition, resulting in a maximum bio-oil yield of 59 wt.%. These results show that the use of microwave absorbents in fMAP increased bio-oil yields and quality, and it is a promising technology to improve the commercial application and economic outlook of microwave pyrolysis technology. Additionally, the use of a different catalyst needs to be considered to improve the bio-oil characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Because heavy metals can be assimilated and accumulated by algal cells, they can then be transferred to higher trophic levels of food chains. We studied the effects of cadmium on protein production and the growth of the marine prasinophyte Tetraselmis gracilis (Kylin) Butcher. By means of toxicological assays, we estimated the LC(50) of cadmium as 3.2 ppm and 1.8 ppm after 48 h and 96 h of exposure to this heavy metal, respectively. The growth curves and survival percentages of cell cultures in the presence of cadmium were determined, and a proportional reduction of both parameters with increasing metal concentrations was found. When chronically exposed to sublethal concentrations of cadmium, T. gracilis contained high levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, one of the main enzymes of the cell's antioxidant defense mechanism. Under these growth conditions, total SOD activity in crude extracts was increased by 41% (at 1.5 ppm) and 107% (at 3.0 ppm). Assays of SOD activity in nondenaturing polyacrylamine gels also showed a similar induction by cadmium. These results show that cadmium has potentially toxic properties since it significantly inhibited the growth of T. gracilis at low concentrations and promoted the induction of SOD activity, suggestive of an oxidative stress state. Besides being the first report of SOD in T. gracilis, this work describes experimental evidence of SOD induction by cadmium in this species.;UNIV SAO PAULO, INST QUIM, DEPT BIOQUIM, BR-05508 SAO PAULO, SP, BRAZIL| UNIV SAO PAULO, INST OCEANOG, DEPT OCEANOG BIOL, BR-05508 SAO PAULO, SP, BRAZIL;;;Okamoto, Oswaldo Keith/C-5593-2013| Colepicolo, Pio/C-1349-2013;Okamoto, Oswaldo Keith/0000-0002-8528-6225;;;;57;74;84;1;18;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0022-3646;1529-8817;;J PHYCOL;J.

The biochemical composition of microalgae can be manipulated by altering the culture conditions and environmental stress to induce the microorganisms to produce high concentrations of a biocompound of interest. In addition, microalgae do not require arable land and can be grown in regions where land use change is not a concern. Thus, the present work is a review of the biotechnological and biochemical potential of microalgae in food, wherein the main functional constituent compounds are in the biomass. The biological effects of these bioactive substances and possible applications for food products are also discussed.;[Vaz, Bruna da Silva| Moreira, Juliana Botelho| de Morais, Michele Greque] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Lab Microbiol & Biochem, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil| [Vieira Costa, Jorge Alberto] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Biochem Engn Lab, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil;Costa, JAV (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Biochem Engn Lab, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.;jorge@pq.cnpq.br;Moreira, Juliana Botelho/D-5322-2017| Costa, Jorge A V/L-3999-2013| de Morais, Michele Greque/J-7539-2015;Costa, Jorge A V/0000-0001-8042-7642| de Morais, Michele Greque/0000-0001-8920-2896| Moreira, Juliana/0000-0003-3340-6333| Vaz, Bruna/0000-0002-0518-4668;CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel)CAPES| CNPq (National Council of Technological and Scientific Development)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| CGTEE (Company of Thermal Generation of Electric Power)| MCTI (Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation);The authors are grateful to CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel), CNPq (National Council of Technological and Scientific Development), CGTEE (Company of Thermal Generation of Electric Power), and MCTI (Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation) for the financial support that made this research possible and for the Program to Support Production of Publication Academic/PROPESP/FURG/2015.;;46;73;76;1;31;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;2214-7993;2214-8000;;CURR OPIN FOOD SCI;Curr.

The best results were obtained with the highest glycerol supplementation (50 mM). In such condition, Chlorella vulgaris and Botryococcus terribilis showed a biomass productivity of 118 and 282 mg l(-1) d(-1), which produced about 18 and 35 mg l(-1) d(-1) of lipids, respectively. Thus, if scaled-up (200 m(3) d(-1) of WW, 240 working days y(-1)) biomass and lipid yields may be about 5.6 tons y(-1) and 894.2 kg y(-1) or 13.5 tons y(-1) and 1.6 tons y(-1) for C vulgaris and B. terribilis, respectively. The mixotrophic production of lipids can generate high quality biodiesel according to estimations using their fatty acids profiles. The whole process can be advantageously combined with the production of other biofuels (e.g. methane and bio-ethanol) in a biorefinery scenario. This combination of algal biomass production with waste treatment (WW amended with glycerol) can have a significant impact in the water treatment sector and local markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The PBR was inoculated with three different microalgae: Chlorella vulgaris (Cv), Scenedesmus obliquus (Sc) and Consortium C (ConsC), isolated from the effluent. The study intends to find the best microalga in terms of wastewater remediation, biomass productivity and quality, for further uses, such as biofuel, biofertilizer and bioplastic production. The experiments achieved volumetric productivities of 0.1 g/L.d (Cv), 0.4 g/L.d (Sc) and 0.(g/L.d (ConsC). The maximum removals attained by Cv, Sc and ConsC were: 84, 95 and 98% for total nitrogen| 95, 92 and 100% for phosphorus| and 36, 63 and 64% for COD, respectively. The treated water had values that are in accordance with environmental legislation (Directive 98/15/CE). Electrocoagulation was tested and resulted in an energy saving of 89%, compared with centrifugation alone. For drying the biomass, a solar dryer was used.

The current study investigated replacement of chemical fertilizers with nutrients sourced from primary and secondary wastewater effluents and anaerobic digestion centrate (ADC). Although primary wastewater effluent possessed a high optical density (OD) and bacterial contamination, it was a superior growth medium for microalgal cultivation than nutrient-scarce secondary effluent. Chlorella sorokiniana and Scenedesmus acutus f. alternans showed higher growth rates, productivities, and robustness than other species or poly-cultures of five species. While supplementing with 5-10% nutrient-rich ADC increased wastewater OD, it also enhanced microalgal growth rates from 0.2-0.3 d(-1) to 0.7-0.9 d(-1) and biomass productivity from 10 to 20 mg L-1 d to 40-60 mg L-1 d with greater improvements for secondary effluents. Supplementation with ADC also increased nutrient concentrations (N, P, Mn, B, Zn, Co by > 100% and S, Mg, Ca, Mo by 20-60%) and improved the nitrogen to phosphorus (N: P) ratio. Higher ADC dose of 20% inhibited microalgae growth potentially due to ammonia toxicity. Elevation of inoculum doses and light intensity increased final biomass density and productivity, with intensities <140 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1) limiting algal growth rates. Inoculum doses of >= 2.5 x 10(5) cell mL(-1) were most favorable for cultivation of all tested microalgae and for FAME content and composition for a newly characterized strain of Chlorella sorokiniana. Overall, ADC represents an economical fertilizer substitute providing various nutrients needed for microalgal growth and enhancing biofuel sustainability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, significant research and detailed analysis are necessary to identify the circumstances under which such energy sources can contribute to sustainability. This paper reviews the literature of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of microalgae-to-energy technologies and focuses in two categories, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and Net Energy Ratios (NER). The analysis is illustrated with a case study of microalgae biomass combustion to produce heat and compares the influence of different electricity sources with respect to GHG emissions and NER along the supply chain. Selected fossil energy sources were used as reference conditions. The methodology was LCA based on ISO 14044 standard, and most of the data used were extracted from a review of relevant scientific publications. Heat production from microalgae showed higher GHG emissions than those from fossil fuels with United States' electricity grid, but lower than those with the Brazilian one. The NER of heat from microalgae combustion life cycle is still disadvantageous compared to most of fossil options. However, the observation that fossil fuel options performed slightly better than microalgae combustion, in the two categories analyzed, must be understood in the context of a mature fossil energy technology chain. The fossil technology has less potential for improvements, while microalgae technology is beginning and has significant potential for additional innovations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the microalgal harvesting process, the intermediate step of flocculation shows potential in drastically reducing the need for costly centrifugation processes. seeds, which have been used for water treatment due to their high flocculation potential, low cost and low toxicity, are presented in this paper as strong candidate for flocculating a microalgae with high biodiesel production potential. Early results of our group showed a very high flocculation (around 85% of biomass recovery). The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of seed flour concentration, sedimentation time and pH on the flocculation efficiency. Cell suspensions treated with seed flour (1 g L-1) had their flocculation significantly increased with the rise of pH, reaching 89% of flocculation in 120 min at pH 9.2. Sedimentation time of 120 min and a concentration of 0.6 g L-1 proved to be ample for substantial flocculation efficiency. In spite of the need for more research to ensure the economic viability and sustainability of this process, these results corroborate seeds as a strong candidate as a bioflocculant for cells and indicate optimal pH range of its action.;[Luz Lapa Teixeira, Claudia Maria| Kirsten, Fabiana Vasconcelos] Natl Inst Technol, BR-20081312 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil| [Nogueira Teixeira, Pedro Celso] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Lab Cellular Commun, BR-21045900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil;Teixeira, CMLL (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol, Av Venezuela 82,Sala 716, BR-20081312 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;claudia.teixeira@int.gov.br;;;;;;36;58;58;0;51;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0921-8971;1573-5176;;J APPL PHYCOL;J.

In the study presented here, microalgae were isolated from ponds next to a Thermoelectricity Plant, located in southern Brazil, and identified as Synechococcus nidulans and Chlorella vulgaris. The isolated microalgae were grown and compared with two different strains of microalgae, Spirulina sp. and Scenedesmus obliquus, for CO2 biofixation. The microalgae were exposed to 12% CO2, 60 ppm of SO2 and 100 ppm of NO, simulating a gas from coal combustion. The C. vulgaris had similar behavior to Spirulina sp., with 13.43% of maximum daily fixation. The microalgae with the greater fixing capacity were C. vulgaris and Spirulina sp. and these can be grown in electric power plants for CO2 biofixation of the coal combustion gas, which would help reduce global warming.

Chlorella vulgaris (Cv), Scenedesmus obliquus (Sc) and a naturally occurring algal Consortium C (ConsC) were grown in an urban wastewater. The nutrient removals were quite high and the treated water fits the legislation (PT Dec-Lei 236/98) in what concerns the parameters analysed (N, P, COD). After nutrient depletion the microalgae remained two more weeks in the photobioreactor (PBR) under nutritional stress conditions, to induce sugar accumulation (22-43%). The stressed biomass was converted into biohydrogen (bioH(2)), a clean energy carrier, through dark fermentation by a strain of the bacteria Enterobacter aerogenes. The fermentation kinetics were monitored and fitted to a modified Gompertz model. The highest bioH(2) production yield was obtained for S. obliquus (56.8 mL H-2/g(VS)) which was very similar when using the same algae grown in synthetic media. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, maximum cell density, growth curve, lipid content, daily biomass and oil productivities were determined for Chlorella minutissima, Thalassiosira fluviatilis and Thalassiosira pseudonana, strains maintained at the Instituto Oceanografico of the Universidade de Sao Paulo. The microalgal dry biomass was used to evaluate the lipid extraction methodology regarding a sonication bath as pretreatment cell disruption technique followed by vortex mixing and n-hexane as solvent. The results showed a lipid content of 15.5% (% dry weight) for C. minutissima, 40.3% for T fluviatilis and 39.5% for T pseudonana. To determine the feasibility of using microalgae into the biofuel industry is essential to consider the daily biomass and oil productivities along with the lipid content, as could be evidenced in C minutissima. The results indicate that the sonication-assisted method with n-hexane was efficient for lipid extraction in these strains, suggesting a favorable potential for biodiesel production.

Tanfloc is a natural low molecular weight tannin polymer whereas Zetag and Flopam are both synthetic high molecular weight polyacrylamide polymers. Five exponential concentrations (0.55, 1.66, 5, 15 and 45 mg L-1) were tested for freshwater Chlorella vulgaris and marine Nannochloropsis oculata. All polymers were efficient (>90% at >= 1.66 mg L-1) for C. vulgaris. However, for N. oculata, only Tanfloc was effective. Charge density positively influenced flocculation decreasing the required polymer dosage. Restabilization was observed only for synthetic polymers when overdosed. Natural polymers performed similarly for both species. Overall, Tanfloc SL and Flopam FO 4990 SH were the most efficient polymers for microalgae flocculation though Tanfloc is a more economical option (US$37 per ton(-1) of biomass) and environmentally friendly than Flopam (US$171 per ton(-1) of biomass).

Thus, the goal of the present study was to investigate if the presence of microplastics (1-5 mu m diameter) influences the toxicity of the pharmaceuticals procainamide and doxycycline to the marine microalga Tetraselmis chuff. Bioassays (96 h) to investigate the toxicity of those substances individually and in mixtures (i.e. microplasticsprocainamide mixtures and microplastics-doxycycline mixtures) were carried out. Effect criteria were the average specific growth rate (growth rate) and chlorophyll a concentration (chlorophyll). EC10, EC20 and EC50 were determined. Microplastics alone had no significant effects on growth rate up to 41.5 mg/l, whereas chlorophyll was significantly reduced at 0.9 and 2.1 mg/l of microplastics, but not at higher concentrations. The 96 h EC50 (growth rate and chlorophyll, respectively) determined for the other bioassays were: 104 and 143 mg/l for procainamide alone| 125 and 31 mg/l for procainamide in the presence of microplastics| 22 and 14 mg/l for doxycycline alone| 11 and 7 mg/l for doxycycline in the presence of microplastics. Significant differences (p < 0.001) between the toxicity curves of each pharmaceutical alone and in mixture with microplastics were found for procainamide (chlorophyll), and doxycycline (both parameters). Thus, both pharmaceuticals were toxic to T. chuii in the low ppm range, and microplastics-pharmaceutical mixtures were more toxic than the pharmaceuticals alone. Very high decreases of doxycycline concentrations in test media were found, indicating degradation of the antibiotic. Thus, although the biological results are expressed in relation to doxycycline concentration, the effects were likely caused by a mixture of the parental compound and its degradation products. The concentrations of microplastics and pharmaceuticals tested (low ppm range) are higher than those expected to be found in waters of the most part of marine ecosystems (ppt or ppb ranges). However, considering the widespread contamination by microplastics and pharmaceuticals, the concentrations already found in waters, sediments and/or organism of heavily polluted areas, the long-term exposure (over generations) of wild populations to such substances in polluted ecosystems and the possibilities of bioaccumulation and toxicological interactions, these findings are of concern and further research on microplastics-pharmaceuticals toxicological interactions is needed.;[Prata, Joana C.| Lavorante, Beatriz R.

The method is low-priced and based on five steps of isocratic elutions. The first step employs the mixture methanol: tetrahydrofuran: 10 mmol L-1 phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at the volumetric ratio of 8:1:91| the other steps use methanol: 10 mmol L-1 phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at volumetric ratios of 20:80, 35:65, SO:SO and 65:35. At a flow rate of 10 mu L s(-1) a 25 mm long-column was able to separate aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), glutamine (Gln), glycine (Gly), threonine (Thr), citruline (Ctr), arginine (Arg), alanine (Ala), tyrosine (Tyr), phenylalanine (Phe), ornithine (Orn) and lysine (Lys) with resolution >1.2 as well as methionine (Met) and valine (Val) with resolution of 0.6. Under these conditions isoleucine (Ile) and leucine (Leu) co-eluted. The entire cycle of amino acids derivatization, chromatographic separation and column conditioning at the end of separation lasted 25 min. At a flow rate of 40 mu L s(-1) such time was reduced to 10 min at the cost of resolution worsening for the pairs Ctr/Arg and Orn/Lys. The detection limits varied from 0.092 mu mol L-1 for Tyr to 0.51 mu mol L-1 for Orn. The method was successfully applied to the determination of intracellular free amino acids in the green alga Tetraselmis gracilis during a period of seven days of cultivation. Samples spiked with known amounts of amino acids resulted in recoveries between 94 and 112%. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;[Rigobello-Masini, Marilda| Penteado, Jose C.

The effects of pressure and temperature on the yield and chemical composition of the extracts were assessed. The experiments were conducted at temperatures of 20-70 degreesC and pressures of 15-180 bar. The solvent mass flow rate was 3.33 x 10(-5) kg/s. Statistical analysis showed that neither the temperature nor the pressure significantly affected the total yield, but both the temperature and the pressure affected the extraction rate, and the effect of the temperature prevailed over that of the pressure. The extracts were rich in essential fatty acids and carotenes, and at 100 bar and 45 degreesC the extract contained no carotenes. Temperatures larger than 50 degreesC degraded the carotenes, as expected.

This study investigated the interactions between intact cells of toxic (Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutzing) Kutzing) and nontoxic (Microcystis panniformis Komarek et al.) cyanobacteria with those of green algae (Monoraphidium convolutum (Corda) Komarkova-Legnerova and Scenedesmus acuminatus (Largerheim) Chodat) as well as the effects of their respective crude extracts (5 and 10 mu g.L-1) on their growth under controlled conditions. M. aeruginosa and M. panniformis were able to significantly (p < 0.05) inhibit the growth of the green algae with M. convolutum being the most affected. The green alga S. acuminatus in return was able to inhibit the growth of the both cyanobacteria. In response to the presence of a competing species in the growth medium, M. aeruginosa significantly increased its MC production per cell with the progression of the experiment, having the highest concentration at the end of the experiment. On the other hand, the extracts of the cyanobacteria had no significant inhibitory effect on the green algal strains investigated, while those of the green algae also had significant inhibitory effect on the growth of M. aeruginosa. In conclusion, both cyanobacterial and green algal strains investigated were negatively affected by the presence of competing species. M. aeruginosa responded to the presence of green algae by increasing its MC production. The green algal strains significantly inhibited the growth of M. aeruginosa.;[Bittencourt-Oliveira, Maria do Carmo| Chia, Mathias Ahii| Bezerra de Oliveira, Helton Soriano| Cordeiro Araujo, Micheline Kezia] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Biol Sci, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil| [Bittencourt-Oliveira, Maria do Carmo| Bezerra de Oliveira, Helton Soriano| Cordeiro Araujo, Micheline Kezia| Reis Molica, Renato Jose] Rural & Fed Univ Pernambuco, Grad Program Bot, BR-52171030 Recife, PE, Brazil| [Santos Dias, Carlos Tadeu] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Exact Sci, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil;Bittencourt-Oliveira, MD (corresponding author), Rural & Fed Univ Pernambuco, Grad Program Bot, Rua D Manoel de Medeiros S-N, BR-52171030 Recife, PE, Brazil.;mbitt@usp.br;Chia, Mathias/E-3448-2013| Dias, Carlos/G-5817-2015| Molica, Renato Jose Reis/Z-3531-2019| Bittencourt-Oliveira, Maria do Carmo MC/C-1597-2012| Molica, Renato/J-2630-2012| Cordeiro-Araujo, Micheline Kezia/L-2166-2015;Chia, Mathias/0000-0002-3549-5475| Dias, Carlos/0000-0003-1015-1761| Molica, Renato Jose Reis/0000-0002-6579-6594| Bittencourt-Oliveira, Maria do Carmo MC/0000-0002-4198-8110| Cordeiro-Araujo, Micheline Kezia/0000-0002-5073-3689;Sao Paulo Research FoundationFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [FAPESP-2011/50840-0, 2013/11306-3]| Brazilian National Research CouncilNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [CNPq-301739/2011-0];This study was supported by grants from Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP-2011/50840-0 and 2013/11306-3 to M.A. Chia) and Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq-301739/2011-0).;;44;43;47;3;105;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0921-8971;1573-5176;;J APPL PHYCOL;J.

Photoautotrophic batch cultures grown at 20 C and 50 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) showed that N. oceanica had the least TAG content and TAG productivity of the three microalgae. Hence, effects of temperature and light intensity on growth rate and accumulation of TAG were subsequently assessed only in I. galbana and P. tricornuturn by cultivation at 20 and 30 degrees C under 50, 300 and 600-mu mol photons m(-2) s. Although P. tricornutum did not grow at temperatures higher than 20 degrees C, an increase in both TAG content (from 28.37 to 39.53%) and productivity (from 15.58 to 31.39 mg L-1 d(-1)) was observed at the highest irradiance values. We also found that combined effects of temperature and light intensity enhanced TAG content (from 18.59 to 31.71%) and productivity (from 11.76 to 21.67 mg L-1 d(-1)) in I. galbana.

Batch-cultured cells in N-sufficient medium showed a 2.5-fold increase in total carbohydrate content, and a 33% increase in cell volume when the cultures reached the stationary growth phase. These cultures also increased the ratio of phycoerythrin (PE)/hydrosoluble proteins from 6 to 22% by the 4th and 10th day of culture, respectively. In contrast, light-saturated photosynthetic activity (P-m) progressively decreased, and the value obtained at the beginning of the stationary phase was about 45% of that obtained for cells in the late exponential growth phase. Transfer to N-lacking medium caused a 3.2-fold increase in cell volume. N starvation also triggered a rapid decline in N-containing compounds such as hydrosoluble proteins and photosynthetic pigments, causing an almost complete loss of PE. The ratio of PE/hydrosoluble proteins decreased from 6 to 1% after 6 d of N deprivation. Furthermore, the PSII fluorescence capacity declined under N-starved conditions, which caused a pronounced decrease in both the P-m (circa 90%) and the apparent photosynthetic efficiency (circa 55%). Under these conditions. photosynthetically fixed carbon was used to synthesize large amounts of carbohydrates. We suggest that, in addition to the role of phycoerythrin as a light-harvesting pigment, Rhodomonas sp. responds to N-depleted conditions by mobilizing combined nitrogen from biliproteins.

The carotenoid profile from microalgae biomass was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode array and mass spectrometry detectors. A total of twenty carotenoids were separated from the biomass. The all-trans-beta-carotene (70.22 mu g/g), all-trans-zeaxanthin (26.25 mu g/g), all-trans-lutein (21.92 mu g/g), all-trans-echinenone (19.87 mu g/g) and cis-echinenone (15.70 mu g/g) were the major ones. For the production of single-cell carotenoids it is possible to estimate a total carotenoid production of up to 107,902.5 kg/year in an industrial scale. Based on these results, we observed the potential of P. autumnale to the production of microalgal carotenoid in agroindustrial wastewater.

In this study chromium-aluminum mixed oxide catalyst was investigated for catalytic conversion of microalgal lipids to biodiesel. Lipids from Scenedesmus obliquus grown in an open raceway pond (3000L) was used as feedstock. Reaction variables such as temperature, methanol to oil molar ratio and catalyst amount were optimized using response surface methodology. FAME conversion of 98.28% was achieved using chromium-aluminum catalyst at 80 degrees C, with methanol to oil molar ratio of 20:1 and catalyst amount of 15%. Catalytic efficiency of this heterogeneous solid acid catalyst was compared to a homogeneous acid catalyst (sulfuric acid). Chromium-aluminum mixed oxide catalyst can be effectively used for 4 batches of conversion reactions without significant loss in its activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, forty microalgae strains were screened for growth in sugarcane vinasse at different concentrations. Two microalgae strains, Micractinium sp. Embrapa| LBA32 and C. biconvexa Embrapa| LBA40, presented vigorous growth in a light-dependent manner even in undiluted vinasse under non-axenic conditions. Microalgae strains presented higher biomass productivity in vinasse-based media compared to standard Bold's Basal Medium in cultures performed using 15 L airlift flat plate photobioreactors. Chemical composition analyses showed that proteins and carbohydrates comprise the major fractions of algal biomass. Glucose was the main monosaccharide detected, ranging from 46% to 76% of the total carbohydrates content according to the strain and culture media used. This research highlights the potential of using residues derived from ethanol plants to cultivate microalgae for the production of energy and bioproducts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, storage leaks are possible resulting in several effects in the ecosystem. Laboratory-scale experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of CO2 leakage on the fate of metals and on the growth of the microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Metal contaminated sediments were collected and submitted to acidification by means of CO2 injection or by adding HCl. Sediments elutriate were prepared to perform toxicity tests. The results showed that sediment acidification enhanced the release of metals to elutriates. Iron and zinc were the metals most influenced by this process and their concentration increased greatly with pH decreases. Diatom growth was inhibited by both processes: acidification and the presence of metals. Data obtained is this study is useful to calculate the potential risk of CCS activities to the marine environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;[De Orte, M. R.| Sarmiento, A.

Highly porous scaffolds can be produced by electrospinning containing biomass of Spirulina. The goal of this contribution was therefore to establish spinning conditions allowing to produce well defined nanofibers with diameters down to about 100 nm and to produce nanofibers with various concentration of the biomass for subsequent studies in tissue engineering applications. The experimental results reveal that the blend system PEO/biomass is behaved surprisingly well in electrospinning. Very thin bead-free nanofibers with diameters of about 110 nm can be produced for different biomass contents of up to 67 wt.% of the nanofibers and for PEO concentrations in the spinning solution well below 4 wt.%. These results suggest to us the use of the biomass containing nanofibers as extracellular matrices for stem cell culture and future treatment of spinal chord injury. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The highly proteinaceous microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has some attributes that can make it an interesting organism for large-scale biomass generation such as: high growth rates, homogeneous biochemical characteristics, robustness and high adaptability, and it can grow both in the light and dark. Thus, in this work the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was characterized using several techniques, to analyze its potential as feedstock in fuel and chemical production. Analytical pyrolysis was performed with and without catalysts. The tests were performed at 450 degrees C, 550 degrees C, 650 degrees C, and 750 degrees C in a Pyroprobe CDS 5200. For the catalytic tests a ratio of 1:2 (catalyst:biomass) was used. Non-catalytic pyrolysis indicated that the increase in the temperature increased the amount of hydrocarbon compounds and decreased oxygenated compounds. The bio-oil produced from catalytic pyrolysis showed a decrease in the nitrogenated compounds, which indicate that the addition of a hydrotalcite catalyst that can improve the bio-oil composition.

These organisms can also synthesize long-chain fatty acids in the form of triacylglycerols, such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), linolenic acid (LA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and arachidonic acid (AA). The aim of this study was to determine the chemical composition and measure protein, carbohydrates, fibers, lipids as well as the fatty acids composition of six microalgae species with potential application in the food industry. Two freshwater species, Chlorella vulgaris and Spirulina platensis, and four marine species, Nannochloropsis oculata, Nannochloropsis gaditana, Porphyridium cruentum, and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, were used in the experiments. Intracellular protein was the most prominent algal component (42.8-35.4 %), followed by carbohydrate + fiber (32.3-28.6 %), and lipids (15.6-5.3 %). N. gaditana is rich in saturated fatty acids, mainly palmitic acid (5.1 g/100 g), while the cells of S. platensis and C. vulgaris algae are abundant in GLA (1.9 g/100 g) and ALA (2.8 g/100 g) acids, respectively. P. cruentum differs from other algae, because it contains a large amount of AA (3.7 g/100 g). The marine microorganisms N. oculata and P. tricornutum are also a source of essential long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA-E center dot 3), mainly composed of EPA and DHA. Our results suggest that the freshwater species C. vulgaris and S. platensis are attractive nutritional supplements because of their low fiber and high protein/carbohydrate contents, while the marine species P. tricornutum and N. oculata can enrich foods with LC-PUFA-omega 3, because of their favorable omega 3/omega 6 ratio.;[Matos, Angelo Paggi| Siegel Moecke, Elisa Helena| Sant'Anna, Ernani Sebastiao] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Lab Food Biotechnol, Av Admar Gonzaga 1346, BR-88034001 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [Feller, Rafael| de Oliveira, Jose Vladimir| Furigo Junior, Agenor] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Chem & Food Engn, Rua Joao Pio Duarte Silva 241, BR-88037000 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [Siegel Moecke, Elisa Helena] Southern Univ Santa Catarina, Lab Environm Engn, Unidade Pedra Branca, Av Pedra Branca, BR-88137270 Palhoca, SC, Brazil| [Derner, Roberto Bianchini] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Aquaculture, Lab Algae Cultivat, Servidao Coroas 503, BR-88061600 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil;Matos, AP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Lab Food Biotechnol, Av Admar Gonzaga 1346, BR-88034001 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;angelosotam@gmail.com| rafafeller@gmail.com;Matos, Angelo/I-6925-2018| Derner, Roberto Bianchini/F-1766-2015;Matos, Angelo/0000-0002-6600-2290| Derner, Roberto Bianchini/0000-0001-6474-1287| Moecke, Elisa Helena Siegel/0000-0002-2663-6010;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq, Brazil)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)CAPES;The authors would like to thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq, Brazil) and Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) for financial support and doctoral scholarship to AP Matos and R Feller.;;50;37;39;7;127;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0003-021X;1558-9331;;J AM OIL CHEM SOC;J.

This necessity has created opportunities for the use of microalgae as a biofuel. The use of microalgae as a feedstock source for bioethanol production requires high yields of both biomass and carbohydrates. With mixotrophic cultures, wastewater can be used to culture algae. The aim of the study was to increase the carbohydrate content in the microalgae Spirulina with the additions of residues from the ultra and nanofiltration of whey protein. The nutrient deficit in the Zarrouk medium diluted to 20% and the addition of 2.5% of both residue types led to high carbohydrate productivity (60 mg L-1 d(-1)). With these culture conditions, the increase in carbohydrate production in Spirulina indicated that the conditions were appropriate for use with microalgae as a feedstock in the production of bioethanol.

Cellulase, glucohydrolase and an enzyme mix composed of cellulase, glucohydrolase and xylanase were selected based on the microalgae cell wall composition (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and glycoprotein). All of them increased organic matter solubilisation, obtaining high values already after 6 h of pretreatment with an enzyme dose of 1% for cellulase and the enzyme mix. BMP tests with pretreated microalgae showed a methane yield increase of 8 and 15% for cellulase and the enzyme mix, respectively. Prospective research should evaluate enzymatic pretreatments in continuous anaerobic reactors so as to estimate the energy balance and economic cost of the process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Stem cells were cultivated in scaffolds constructed by the electrospinning technique, using poly-D,L-lactic acid (PDLLA) associated or not with Spirulina biomass (PDLLA/Sp), which has bioactive components of interest for tissue engineering (TE). Physicochemical analyses were performed, such as morphology, fiber diameter, degradability, residual solvent, roughness, contact angle with water, among others. SCs adhesion, proliferation and scaffold cytotoxicity were also evaluated. Nanofibers without beads and with characteristics similar to the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) in terms of mechanical and topographical properties were obtained. In biological tests it was found that SCs adhered more and had greater viability in the PDLLA/Sp molds, when compared with the PDLLA scaffolds. The scaffolds were shown to be atoxic for the SCs.

Twenty-four carotenoids, three phycobiliproteins and two chlorophylls were identified. The major carotenoids of biomass were all-trans-beta-carotene (225.44 mu g. g(-1)), all-trans-lutein (117.56 mu g.g(-1)) and all-trans-zeaxanthin (88.46 mu g.g(-1)). Furthermore, characteristic carotenoids in cyanobacteria such as echinenone (79.07 mu g.g(-1)), myxoxanthophyll (18.83 mu g.g(-1)) and canthaxanthin (1.89 mu g.g(-1)) were found. The chlorophyll a (2.700 mu g.g(-1)) and C-phycocyanin (2.05 x 10(5) mu g.g(-1)) were predominant pigments in the other fractions of color compounds from biomass. The carotenoid and chlorophyll extracts were shown to be potent scavengers of peroxyl radical, being almost 28 and 85 times more potent alpha-tocopherol respectively, and for phycobiliproteins, the antioxidant capacity was 274 mu mol trolox.g(-1) (dry wt).

The discharge of these effluents into the environment without treatment has reduced the availability and quality of natural resources, representing a serious threat to the balance of different ecosystems and human health. Universal access to water and global warming are topics of intense concern and are listed as priorities in the vast majority of global scientific, social and political guidelines. Conventional techniques to treat liquid and gaseous effluents pose economic and/or environmental limitations that prevent their use in certain applications. The technique of phycoremediation, which uses microalgae, macroalgae, and cyanobacteria for the removal or biotransformation of pollutants, is an emerging technology that has been highlighted due to its economic viability and environmental sustainability. This literature review discusses different techniques of microalgae cultivation and their use in the phycoremediation of contaminants in wastewater.;[Pacheco, Marcondes M.| Hoeltz, Michele| Moraes, Maria S.

Also, HMWM obtained from the reservoir water as well as from a mixture of the three algae materials were studied. The HMWM of the cyanophytes and the mixture of the three algae materials complexed Cu and Cd, whereas the HMWM of the diatom and that from the reservoir water complexed only Cu. Two classes of ligands of intermediate to weak binding strength were obtained after Scatchard plot analysis of the titration data. The cyanophytes and the mixture HMWM presented higher conditional stability constants for Cu class-1 ligands (log K-1' = 9.2-9.5) than the HMWM derived from the diatom and the reservoir water (log K-1' = 8.6-8.8). Higher proportions of acidic monosaccharides corresponded to higher K-1' of Cu and Cd complexation, yet no relation was observed among complexation parameters and elemental analysis. This study points out Cu ligands of intermediate to weak binding strength in the excreted HMWM of dominant microalgae and in the HMWM of the reservoir water, while Cd was solely complexed by ligands isolated from the cyanophyte HMWM.

The hypothesis of the entrepreneurs, who were associated to the scientists uncharged of this research, was that recycled petrochemical waste may provide different gasoline formulations, having different toxic properties| the correlation between the gasoline formulations and their components' toxicological effects might contribute to the reformulation of the products, in such a way that the gasoline generated could be less toxic and less harmful to the environment. The aim of this research was to determine the toxic effects of 14 different types of gasoline (formulated, in accordance with National Petroleum Agency standards, from petrochemical waste), on Tetraselmis chuii (microalgae culture) and Crassostrea rhizophorae (embryos). Microalgae and oyster embryos were exposed to different gasoline formulations water-soluble fractions (WSF) at a range of concentrations (0%, 4.6%, 10.0%, 22.0%, 46.0%, and 100%), for 96 and 24h, respectively. The tests were carried out under controlled conditions. End-points have been CI50-96h (concentration causing 50% growth inhibition in microalgae cultures) and EC50-24h (concentration causing abnormalities on 50% of the exposed embryos). Through these procedures, gasoline formulations, which represent the lowest environmental risk, were selected. Bioassays carried out on the 8 different gasoline components aimed to correlate gasoline toxicity with the toxic potential of its components. The analysis of principal components showed that the C9DI, a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons of 9 carbon atoms, had the highest level of toxic potential, followed by C9S (a mixture of aromatics with 9-11 carbon atoms) and heavy naphtha. The results showed gasoline formulations 1-4 (monoaromatic hydrocarbons being the most conspicuous components) to be the least toxic, whilst formulations 12-14 (having higher content of C9131, C9S and naphtha) were found to be the most harmful to organisms. This study led to the identification of the most toxic WSF gasoline components (C9DI and C9S), and to the possibility of developing more ecocompatible gasoline formulations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, high metal loads are usually necessary for obtaining 50% effect concentration (EC50) values based on cell number or chlorophyll a. Thus, sensitive parameters, which promptly respond to low dissolved metal variations at environmentally relevant concentrations, are much needed. The genus Scenedesmus, a coenobium-forming freshwater microalga, is cosmopolitan and inhabits pristine and contaminated waters. The present investigation addressed cellular phenotypic alterations in Scenedesmus acuminatus (Largerheim) Chodat 1902 caused by the presence of copper. Copper toxicity to the alga was investigated under laboratory-controlled conditions using a concentration range of 10(-8) mol l(-1) to 10(-3) mol l(-1) total dissolved Cu2+, thus including environmentally relevant concentrations. Free Cu2+ concentrations were determined using an ion-selective electrode calibrated with a metal ion buffer. The phenotypic plasticity of S. acuminatus was measured as the number of cells per coenobia and found to be readily affected at low copper concentrations. Under healthy conditions (10(-8) mol l(-1) total dissolved Cu2+, 10(-11) mol l(-1) free Cu2+) S. acuminatus formed eight-celled coenobia, whereas at 10(-7) mol l(-1) total dissolved Cu2+ (3 X 10(-11) mol l(-1) free Cu2+) these were absent and at 10(-5) mol l(-1) total dissolved Cu2+ (5 X 10(-8) mol l(-1) free Cu2+) free cells were predominant. Chlorophyll a synthesis was affected by 5 X 10(-8) mol l(-1) free Cu2+ or higher. EC50 (3.3 X 10(-5) mol l(-1) free Cu2+) was obtained using chlorophyll a values after 96-h exposure to the toxicant. The number of cells per coenobia was a more sensitive parameter than chlorophyll a to assess Cu toxicity, and at concentrations that may be encountered in the environment.;Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Bot, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| Inst Pesquisas Jardim Bot Rio De Janeiro, BR-22470180 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil;Lombardi, AT (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Bot, CP 676, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;lombardi@power.ufscar.br;Vieira, Armando AH/I-3894-2013;;;;;25;31;32;1;22;INT PHYCOLOGICAL SOC;LAWRENCE;NEW BUSINESS OFFICE, PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA;0031-8884;;;PHYCOLOGIA;Phycologia;JAN;2007;46;1;;;;;74;78;;10.2216/06-40.1;;;5;Plant Sciences| Marine & Freshwater Biology;Plant Sciences| Marine & Freshwater Biology;125MY;WOS:000243447300009;;;;;2021-01-01

So, the objective of this study was the use green microalgae Chlorella pyrenoidosa for the removal of rhodamine B dye from dyeing stones effluents. Biosorption was carried out in order to evaluate effects of pH, contact time and temperature. Biosorption kinetics was studied for the dye concentration range of 20-500 mg L-1 using pseudo first order, pseudo second order and Elovich models. Equilibrium isotherms were analyzed by the Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips and Temkin models. Results showed that when the initial dye concentration was 100 mg L-1, the microalgae biomass presented the highest biosorption capacity, at pH 8.0 and temperature of 25 degrees C. The time required to reach the equilibrium was 120 min. The kinetic model that better fitted the experimental data was pseudo-second order, with an average relative error lesser than 2.4%. The Sips isotherm presented the best performance, being the calculated values of biosorption capacities of 63.14| 53.46 and 54.20 mg g(-1) for the temperatures of 25, 35 and 45 degrees C respectively, demonstrating that a temperature increase has a negative effect on the biosorption capacity. Results indicated that the biosorption using Chlorella pyrenoidosa has a great potential for rhodamine B removal from dyeing stones effluents. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In The Netherlands, an integrated microalgal biorefinery delivered the following products: digestate, electricity, heat available for a nearby bio-ethanol facility and algae oil and meal. Pilot scale (500 m(2)) data were used to conduct an exergy analysis (EA), which revealed the process inefficiencies of energy-intensive processes such as drying (44.01%) and inoculum production (54.98%). An attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) using system expansion exposed the high contribution of biomass digestion to the total resource footprint of the biorefinery (72.74%) due to the high daily demand for biomass and electricity consumption of the dosage system. In this study, algal meal was compared with soybean meal, which is the most commonly used protein-rich animal feed ingredient| it is produced in Brazil and transported to The Netherlands. Because algae production is a young, small-scale technology, the resource footprint of the large-scale soy meal production was a factor of 102 lower, mainly as a result of the energy-intensive algae cultivation stages. A sensitivity analysis showed that the resource footprint of algal meal production could be comparable with soy meal when, overall, the areal biomass productivity increases, electricity production is based on more renewable sources (wind) and the energy consumption from mixing and blowing flue gases into the ponds decreases.

The biomass was produced in a batch cylindrical bioreactor operating isothermally at 30 degrees C, with the pH adjusted and maintained at 8.0, an inoculum concentration of 100 mg/L and ON ratio of 50. The biomass was separated by centrifugation and dried in a batch tray dryer with parallel air flow (1.5 m/s) at temperatures of 40, 50 and 60 degrees C and tray thicknesses of 5 and 7 mm, followed by a biochemical evaluation. The results obtained showed that the parboiled rice effluent was a culture medium with potential for the production of single cell protein, and that the biomass produced represented an important source of protein, carbohydrate and lipids. The drying conditions were shown to significantly affect (alpha = 0.05) the macronutrient composition of the biomass with respect to the protein, carbohydrate and lipid contents. The lipid profile showed a predominance of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially that of gamma linolenic acid, but the drying conditions did not influence the polyunsaturated/saturated ratio of the biomass.

Tannery wastewaters have high organic content and are rich in nitrogenous compounds which are essential for microalgae cultivation. Thus, the aim of this study was to use tannery wastewater as alternative cultivation medium for microalgae biomass production aiming to treat this effluent. Biomass production and removal of ammoniacal nitrogen, phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand by the microalgae Scenedesmus sp., cultivated in tannery wastewater, was studied under different wastewater concentrations (between 20% and 100%), light intensity (between 80 and 200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) at temperature of 25 degrees C and constant aeration. The results showed that the adaptation of microalgae for this nutrient source was effective. The cultivation of Scenedesmus sp. showed maximum biomass concentration (0.90 g L-1) and maximum removal of ammoniacal nitrogen (85.63%), phosphorus (96.78%) and COD (80.33%) at a tannery wastewater of 88.4% and light intensity of 182.5 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

The tannin-based biopolymers Tanfloc SG and SL and the polyacrylamide polymers Flopam FO 4800 SH and FO 4990 SH were tested for flocculation of two microalgae models, the freshwater Chlorella vulgaris and the marine Nannochloropsis oculata. Both biomass concentration and AOM presence affected all polymers evaluated, whereas salinity and pH affected only Flopam and Tanfloc, respectively. A restabilization effect due to overdosing was only observed for Flopam polymers and increasing Tanfloc dose resulted in improved efficiency. Flopam polymers showed a significant decrease in the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II as function of polymer dose for Chlorella, which supported the need for toxicological studies to assess the potential toxicity of Flopam. In overall, Tanfloc was not affected by salinity nor presented potential toxicity therefore being recommended for the flocculation of both freshwater and marine species.;[Roselet, Fabio| Roselet, Milene| Abreu, Paulo Cesar] Fundacao Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Lab Microalgae Prod, Ave Italia,Km 08, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil| [Vandamme, Dries| Muylaert, Koenraad] KU Leuven Kulak, Lab Aquat Biol, Etienne Sabbelaan 53, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium;Roselet, F (corresponding author), Fundacao Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Lab Microalgae Prod, Ave Italia,Km 08, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.;fabio.roselet@furg.br;Vandamme, Dries/I-7553-2015| Roselet, Fabio/S-6421-2016| Abreu, Paulo Cesar/A-5145-2013;Vandamme, Dries/0000-0003-0941-2434| Roselet, Fabio/0000-0002-1428-664X| Abreu, Paulo Cesar/0000-0002-7657-1112| Muylaert, Koenraad/0000-0001-9645-4063;Sandwich Ph.D. grant from Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [11839-13-9]| Research Foundation Flanders Belgium (FWO)FWO [12D8914N];The authors would like to thank TANAC and SNF Floerger for kindly providing polymers.

Fifty-one freshwater green microalgae strains isolated from Brazil, the largest biodiversity reservoir in the neotropics, were submitted to DNA barcoding. Currently available universal primers for ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region amplification were sufficient to successfully amplify and sequence 47 (92%) of the samples. On the other hand, new sets of primers had to be designed for rbcL, which allowed 96% of the samples to be sequenced. Thirty-five percent of the strains could be unambiguously identified to the species level based either on nuITS1 or nuITS2 sequences' using barcode gap calculations. nuITS2 Compensatory Base Change (CBC) and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region phylogenetic analysis, together with morphological inspection, confirmed the identification accuracy. In contrast, only 6% of the strains could be assigned to the correct species based solely on rbcL sequences. In conclusion, the data presented here indicates that either nuITS1 or nuITS2 are useful markers for DNA barcoding of freshwater green microalgae, with advantage for nuITS2 due to the larger availability of analytical tools and reference barcodes deposited at databases for this marker.;[Hadi, Samed I.

The aims of this study are to identify the best method of lipid extraction and provide high FAME levels and to evaluate their fatty acid profiles. Six lipid extraction methodologies in three microalgae species were tested in comparison with the direct transesterification (DT) of microalgal biomass method. The choice of extraction method affected both the oily extract yield and the FAME composition of the microalgae and consequently may affect the properties of biodiesel. The efficiency of different lipid extraction methods is affected by the solvent polarity, which extracts different target compounds from lipid matrix. Dichloromethane/methanol extraction and Folch extraction produced the largest oil extract yields, but extraction with hexane/ethanol resulted in the best ester profile and levels. Performing DT reduces the volume of extractor solvent, the time and cost of FA composition analysis, as well as, presents less steps for fatty acid quantification. DT provided biomass FAME levels of 50.2, 636.4, and 258.2 mg.g(-1) in Nannochlorophisis oculata, Chaetoceros muelleri, and Chlorella sp., respectively. On the basis of an analysis of the fatty acids profiles of different species, C. muelleri is a promising microalga for biodiesel production. Depending on the extraction method, Chlorella sp. and N. oculata can be considered as an alternative in obtaining arachidonic (Aa) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids.;[Soares, Aline Terra| da Costa, Dayane Cristine| Silva, Bruna Ferreira| Antoniosi Filho, Nelson Roberto] Univ Fed Goias, Inst Chem, Lab Methods Extract & Separat LAMES, Goiania, Go, Brazil| [Lopes, Rafael Garcia| Derner, Roberto Bianchini] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Aquaculture, Agr Sci Ctr, LCA, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil;Antoniosi, NR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Goias, Inst Chem, Lab Methods Extract & Separat LAMES, Campus 2,Samambaia,Cx,131, Goiania, Go, Brazil.;nlliantoniosi@gmail.com;Filho, Nelson Roberto Antoniosi/R-8297-2019| Lopes, Rafael/M-5426-2019| Derner, Roberto Bianchini/F-1766-2015| Soares, Aline/C-2774-2017;Filho, Nelson Roberto Antoniosi/0000-0002-3067-0385| Lopes, Rafael/0000-0001-7393-1824| Derner, Roberto Bianchini/0000-0001-6474-1287| Soares, Aline/0000-0001-7627-8891;Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation (MCTI) through FINEP [01.10.0457.00]| CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [574796/2008-8, 309832/2010-1]| CAPESCAPES;The authors would like to express their appreciation to the Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation (MCTI) for financial support provided through FINEP (Agreement No. 01.10.0457.00) and CNPq (Case No. 574796/2008-8), to CAPES for a scholarship awarded to Aline Terra Soares, to CNPq for a research productivity scholarship awarded to Nelson Roberto Antoniosi Filho, (Case No. 309832/2010-1) and to FUNAPE for management of financial resources.;;34;28;28;0;57;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1939-1234;1939-1242;;BIOENERG RES;BioEnergy Res.;SEP;2014;7;3;;;SI;;1035;1044;;10.1007/s12155-014-9446-4;;;10;Energy & Fuels| Environmental Sciences;Energy & Fuels| Environmental Sciences & Ecology;AN9SW;WOS:000340949900028;;;;;2021-01-01

The high-molecular weight material was also investigated for its monosaccharide composition and is further discussed in relation to the copper binding property. S. acuminatus was grown in batch cultures under laboratory controlled conditions and harvested at the beginning of stationary growth phase when exuded organic materials were obtained. Copper-complexing property of the total exuded organic materials and exopolysaccharides before and after freeze-drying was evaluated by complexometric titrations and Scatchard Plot Analysis of the titration data. The results revealed the presence of two copper-complexing ligands in the total exuded material, but only one in the exopolysaccharide. Stronger copper-complexing ligands are associated to low molecular weight compounds (LogK'l = 7.3, LogCLl = -5.6-1 LogK'2 = 6.3, LogCL2 = -5.1), whereas weaker ligands to the high molecular weight fraction (LogK'2 = 6.4, LogCL2 = -5.6). Although freeze-drying the polymeric organic material (exopolysaccharide) may result in conformational changes of the molecule, no effect on copper-complexing properties was detected.

Indeed, the bio-based industry is expected to play a major role in energy security and climate change mitigation during the 21th century. Despite this, there are challenges related to resource consumption, processing optimization and waste minimization that still need to be overcome. In this context, microalgae appear as a promising non-edible feedstock with advantages over traditional land crops, such as high productivity, continuous harvesting throughout the year and minimal problems regarding land use. Importantly, both cultivation and microalgae processing can take place at the same site, which increases the possibilities for process integration and a reduction in logistic costs at biorefinery facilities. This review describes the actual scenario for microalgae biorefineries integration to the biofuels and petrochemical industries in Brazil, while highlighting the major challenges and recent advances in microalgae large-scale production.

In this study, the lipids from Spirulina were obtained by different methods of biomass drying (tray and spouted bed), cell disruption (microwave, autoclaving and milling) and solvent extraction (hot and cold). The average content of lipids extracted by the cold method, using polar solvents, was of 5.8 +/- 0.6 g 100 g(-1). The spouted bed drying with cell disruption by milling achieved the best performance with the hot extraction method. Under these conditions, the TBA value was of 0.57 +/- 0.09 mgMDA kg(-1). FT-IR spectra and thermal analysis indicated that the hot extraction resulted in a more purified lipid extract than the cold extraction. The Brimberg model showed the best fit to the lipid extraction kinetics and the activation energy in the best conditions was of 6.11 +/- 1.41 kJ mol(-1). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The data were interpreted by using conventional isoconversional methods and also by the independent parallel reaction (IPR) model, in which the degradation is considered to happen individually to each pseudo-component of biomass (lipid, carbohydrate and protein). The IPR model allows obtaining the kinetic parameters of the degradation reaction of each component. Three main stages were observed during the gasification process and the differential thermogravimetric curve was satisfactorily fitted by the IPR model considering three pseudocomponents. The comparison of the activation energy values obtained by the methods and those found in the literature for other microalgae was satisfactory. Quantification of reaction products was performed using online gas chromatography. The major products detected were H-2, CO and CH4, indicating the potential for producing fuel gas and syngas from microalgae. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanical pretreatment resulted in a 61.7% increase in soluble Chemical Oxygen Demand. Different hydrolysis conditions were evaluated by varying temperature - T, sulfuric acid concentration - AC and biomass suspension concentration (measured as particulate COD - CODp) using an experimental design. The most significant interaction occurred between AC and T and the hydrolysis condition that showed the best result in the anaerobic digestion step was the condition at 40 degrees C with addition of 0.2% (v/v) acid for 16 h (9.27 L CH4/kg VS). The low methane yields were attributed to inhibitory sodium concentrations for anaerobic digestion. Eliminating inhibitory sodium in the anaerobic digestion by biomass prewashing, there was a 71.5% increase in methane yield for biomass after acid hydrolysis, demonstrating the need for pretreatment and reduction in sodium concentration in the anaerobic digestion.

Here, the synthesis of silver chloride nanoparticles (AgCl-NPs) was consistently evidenced from a commercially valuable microalgae species, Chlorella vulgaris. Incubation of C vulgaris conditioned medium with AgNO3 resulted in a medium color change to yellow/brown (with UV-vis absorbance at 415 nm), indicative of silver nanoparticle formation. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of purified nanoparticles confirmed the presence of both silver and chlorine atoms, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed the typical pattern of cubic crystalline AgCl-NPs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that most particles (65%) were spherical, with average diameter of 9.8 +/- 5.7 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of purified nanoparticle fractions suggested that proteins are the main molecular entities involved in AgCl-NP formation and stabilization. AgCl-NPs (from 10 mu g/mL) decreased by 98% the growth of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative ICIebsiella pneumoniae bacterial pathogens, and had a dose-dependent effect on cell viability, which was measured by automated image-based high content screening (HCS). Ultrastructural analysis of treated bacteria by TEM revealed the abnormal arrangement of the chromosomal DNA. Our findings strongly indicated that the AgCl-NPs from C vulgaris conditioned medium is a promising 'green' alternative for biomedical application as antimicrobials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Microalgae harvested immediately after nutrient removal showed high protein (56-59 %) and carbohydrate (25-34 %) but low lipid (1.8-3 %) contents. Depletion of N or P alone stimulated carbohydrate production at the expenses of proteins. Significant lipid accumulation from 3 % +/- 0.5 to 16.3 % +/- 0.8 was reached only after 25 days following N and P starvation as demonstrated by Nile red-stained cells.

The contribution of the electroflotation system to the concentration of iron or aluminum ions in the treated wastewater is significant, and the use of the iron electrode may be less detrimental to human and animal health due to the lower toxicity remaining concentration in the effluent.

As an abundant photosynthesizer, algae could be an adequate surrogate for biodiesel production. Nevertheless, high production costs, scarce selected species, and inaccurate assumptions about production yields represent industrial uncertainties. In this study, a reliable approach to analyzing algal biodiesel production has been developed based on species-to-species variations in oil productivity and quality. This approach compares biodiesels from Chlorophyta strains with land crop feedstock according to (i) potential yields, (ii) oil quality, and (iii) compliance with biodiesel quality standards. Algal yields were assessed by (i) extrapolating the strain-specific laboratory results to commercial-scale growth systems| (ii) converting volumetric to areal biomass productivity| and (iii) estimating oil yields for each strain, as the product of their projected areal biomass productivity for each growth system, and the oil percentage in biomass as determined in the laboratory. Biodiesel fuel properties were estimated by using fatty acid methyl ester profile predictive models. The Chlorophyta strains in this study provided annual oil yields that were generally higher than those of land crops by one order of magnitude. Six strains yielding more than 40 mg oil l(-1) day(-1) were identified as adequate for sustaining biodiesel production. Trebouxiophyceae algae were the most productive. Critical biodiesel parameters from both feedstock types suggest that most microalgae-derived biodiesels meet international fuel quality standards with better values than those of land crops. Because some of the highly productive feedstock does not simultaneously meet all the standards for a high quality biodiesel, optimization solutions are discussed.;[Nascimento, Iracema Andrade| Izabel Marques, Sheyla Santa| Dominguez Cabanelas, Iago Teles| Hussain, Javid] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, BR-40170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil| [de Souza, Carolina Oliveira| Druzian, Janice Isabel] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Pharm, BR-40170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil| [de Carvalho, Gilson Correia] Univ Fed Bahia, Hlth Sci Inst, Salvador, BA, Brazil| [de Carvalho, Gilson Correia] Univ Fed Bahia, PG Program Ecol & Biomonitoring IBIO, Salvador, BA, Brazil| [Nascimento, Mauricio A.] Univ Fed Bahia, Polytech Inst, BR-40210630 Salvador, BA, Brazil| [Liao, Wei] Michigan State Univ, Dept Biosyst & Agr Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA;Nascimento, IA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Campus Ondina, BR-40170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil.;toiracema@gmail.com;Carvalho, Gilson/U-1770-2019| de Carvalho, Gilson Correia/F-8051-2014| Nascimento, Iracema A/L-5069-2015| Druzian, Janice/G-6884-2015| Souza, Carolina O/G-8869-2015| Hussain, Javid/AAC-5053-2020;Carvalho, Gilson/0000-0003-1800-888X| de Carvalho, Gilson Correia/0000-0003-1800-888X| Oliveira de Souza, Carolina/0000-0002-8028-5418| Druzian, Janice Izabel/0000-0001-8940-6098;National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ)/Science and Technology Ministry, Brazil [574712/2008-9, 551134/2010-0];This work was financially supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ)/Science and Technology Ministry, Brazil (Processes 574712/2008-9 and 551134/2010-0).;;41;24;24;2;38;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1939-1234;1939-1242;;BIOENERG RES;BioEnergy Res.;SEP;2014;7;3;;;SI;;1002;1013;;10.1007/s12155-014-9440-x;;;12;Energy & Fuels| Environmental Sciences;Energy & Fuels| Environmental Sciences & Ecology;AN9SW;WOS:000340949900025;;;;;2021-01-01

The liquid and gaseous wastes from oil refining were considered for the cultivation of Aphanothece microscopica Neigeli in a bubble column photobioreactor. Growth kinetics, carbon dioxide removal and oxygen release rates, carbon balance, lipid production and biofuel quality were determined. The results showed the potential use of oil refinery wastes in microalgae-based systems under optimized culture conditions. The maximum specific growth rate was 1.4 day(-1) and the maximum carbon dioxide elimination capacity was 22.9 mg/L min. Each CO2 mass unit bioconverted resulted in approximately 0.75 O-2 of mass units released. Carbon balance analyses indicated that a small fraction (3.64%) of the carbon dioxide is fixed into a biomass form. Volatile organic compounds (92.0%) were the main products of carbon dioxide transformation in the photobioreactor, in such conditions. For the production of biodiesel, it is possible to obtain 0.08 g(lipid)/L day with this process. The quality properties of the biodiesel were an ester content of 99.7%, a cetane number of 51.3, an iodine value of 79.9 gI(2)/100 g, a degree of insaturation of 65.3% and a cold filter plugging point of 24.9 degrees C. Based on these results, the process developed could be considered a promising emerging biorefinery platform of waste-material-utilization type. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This is the first reported study of biosorption by a cyanobacterium species, which is abundant and easily found in eutrophic lakes and ponds in tropical areas of the world. We also evaluated the effects of different concentrations of Pb2+ on growth rates of M. novacekii. Inactive biomass was characterized by elemental composition, surface area, potentiometric titration, infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The biosorption data of Pb2+ by inactive biomass were analyzed using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Pb2+ concentrations higher than 0.5 mg L-1 inhibited species growth. Potentiometric titrations showed a significantly higher negative surface charge (1.48 +/- 0.22 mmol g(-1)) with two acidic groups (pKa(1) = 3.74 +/- 0.12 and, pKa(2) = 7.25 +/- 0.30). Analysis of inactive M. novacekii cells by infrared spectroscopy suggests that the cell wall carboxyl and amide groups participate in Pb2+ biosorption. The maximum Pb2+ adsorbed was found to be 70 mg g(-1), and the biosorption of Pb2+ on inactive M. novacekii correlated well (R-2 = 0.931) with the Langmuir equation compared to the Freundlich isotherm equation (R-2 = 0.823) in the concentration range studied.

Moreover, the influence of bioaccessibility on composition and bioactivity was evaluated through the application of an in vitro model of the human digestion. The fatty acid (FA) profile was characterized by abundance of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) and, within PUFA, omega 3 PUFA were the most abundant. High contents of myristic, oleic, linoleic, alpha-linolenic, and stearidonic acids as well as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were determined. A low level of hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and polar lipids was observed during digestion. Total lipid bioaccessibility and specific FA bioaccessibility were low (between 7 and 15%). The highest bioaccessibility percentages were determined for palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids as well as total omega 6 PUFA and the lowest bioaccessible percentages were calculated for myristic and stearidonic acids, DHA, and total omega 3 PUFA. Chemical affinity phenomena could be an explanation for these results. Regarding anti-inflammatory activity, it was only detected in the lipid extract of I. galbana prior to digestion (79 +/- 7% of cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2, inhibition). No activity was found in the bioaccessible fraction extract. Apparently, the COX-2 inhibitory compounds were not rendered bioaccessible.;[Bonfanti, C.| Garcia, T.| Tanni, S.] UNESP Univ Estadual Paulista, Botucatu Med Sch, Botucatu Campus, Botucatu, SP, Brazil| [Bonfanti, C.| Cardoso, C.| Afonso, C.| Matos, J.| Garcia, T.| Bandarra, N.

This phenomenon became a major political issue in the fields of science, environment, and economy in current years. Microalgae can convert CO2 into biomass and oxygen through the photosynthesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of diffusers configuration and CO2 flow rate in mass transfer, CO2 fixation efficiency by Spirulina and in the biomass composition produced. Two flow rates (0.05 and 0.3 vvm) and four diffusers (sintered stone (SS), porous curtain (PC), perforated ring (PR) and porous wood (PW)) were used in this study. The maximum CO2 mass transfer coefficient (123.2 h-1) in the CO2-H2O system corresponded to the higher flow rate (0.3 vvm) using the diffuser porous curtain (PC). The maximum biomass productivity (125.9 +/- 5.3 mgL(-1) d(-1)) was observed for PC with a flow rate of 0.05 vvm. Increasing the flow rate (0.3 vvm) with PC resulted in a 26% increase in the carbohydrate content in biomass. The results showed a smaller flow rate with porous diffusers might promote an increase in CO2 fixation efficiency by microalgae. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These include fresh microalgae, residual biomass, lipid fraction, crude FAMEs, insoluble fraction and purified FAMEs from microalgae Chlorella sp. A microwave-assisted digestion procedure in closed vessels was applied for sample digestion and subsequent element determination by inductively coupled plasma-based techniques. The proposed method was suitable for the multi-element determination in FAMEs and its fractions obtained from microalgae. The element concentration was compared with results found in the literature and a careful discussion about the use of residual biomass for different applications was performed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the production processes must be energetically and economically viable. Therefore, an in situ methanolysis process is proposed for biodiesel production directly from microalgae biomass, to avoid the need for the separation and extraction steps. RESULTS: Biodiesel was obtained using methanol as the methylation reactant for the transesterification reaction and hydrochloric acid as the catalyst precursor, at 80 degrees C for 2 h of reaction. A mass return of 23.07 +/- 2.76% (m/m) was obtained. Spectrometry in the infrared region showed that the product had equivalent bands of axial deformation of C=O, C-O and C-H, i.e. an ester. Tests showed the chromatographic profile of fatty acids in the sample. A process energetic efficiency value of 1.17 was obtained for microalgae derived biodiesel, which is higher than from soybean and sunflower, reportedly 1.06 and 1.12. CONCLUSIONS: Industrial sustainability results from low energetic, economic and environmental losses. The microalgae in situ methanolysis process showed greater fuel available energy than energy consumption, therefore is energetically sustainable. Economic and environmental issues should still be addressed. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry;[Carvalho Junior, Rui M.| Vargas, Jose V. C.| Marino, Claudia E.

The method consists of extraction of thiamine and its derivatives in acid solution, followed by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The detection limit is as low as 15 fmol of thiamine. For comparison to microalgae, the method has been applied to evaluate thiamine levels in the crustacean Artemia salina Leach and is suitable for nutritional studies of the food web of the Baltic salmon, which suffers from thiamine deficiency. This method of HPLC analysis can be readily utilized to follow uptake and interconversion of thiamine and its phosphate esters in many micro- and macro-algae.

However, there is an ecological risk associated with potential CO2 leakages from the sub-seabed storages sites. To evaluate the effects related to CO2 leakages, laboratory-scales experiments were performed using the marine microalgae Pleurochrysis roscoffensis. Five Zn concentrations were tested at different pHs to study Zn toxicity under acidified conditions. Seawater was collected and submitted to acidification by means of CO2 injection and by HCl addition. Results showed differences between both acidification techniques: while microalgae growth was enhanced by CO2 supply, reaching the optimal growth at pH 6.5 and full inhibition at pH 5.5, HCl acidification growth was inhibited at pH 6.5. Although small concentrations of Zn were positive for P. roscoffensis growth, Zn toxicity increased at lower pHs, and more severely on samples acidified with HCl. The conclusions obtained in this work are useful to address the potential effects on the marine ecosystem related to changes in metal bioavailability during CO2 leakages scenarios.

This process may be improved by implementing a pretreatment step and by co-digesting the coffee husks with a more liquid biomass. In this context, this study aimed at evaluating the anaerobic co-digestion of coffee husks with microalgal biomass. For this, both substrates were pretreated separately and in a mixture for attaining 15% of total solids (TS), which was demonstrated to be the minimum solid content for pretreatment of coffee husks. The results showed that the anaerobic co-digestion presented a synergistic effect, leading to 17% higher methane yield compared to the theoretical value of both substrates biodegraded separately. Furthermore, thermal hydrolysis pretreatment increased coffee husks anaerobic biodegradability. For co-digestion trials, the highest values were reached for pretreatment at 120 degrees C for 60 min, which led to 196 mLCH(4)/gVS and maximum methane production rate of 0.38 d(-1).;[Passos, Fabiana| Miranda Cordeiro, Paulo Henrique| Lobo Baeta, Bruno Eduardo| de Aquino, Sergio Francisco] Univ Fed Ouro Preto, Dept Chem, Environm & Chem Technol Grp, BR-35400000 Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil| [Passos, Fabiana] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Sanit & Environm Engn, Campus Pampulha,Av Antonio Carlos 6-627, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil| [Isabel Perez-Elvira, Sara] Univ Valladolid, Dept Chem Engn & Environm Technol, C Dr Mergelina S-N, Valladolid, Spain;Passos, F (corresponding author), Univ Fed Ouro Preto, Dept Chem, Environm & Chem Technol Grp, BR-35400000 Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil.;fabiana@desa.ufmg.br;Aquino, Sergio F./V-6811-2019| BAETA, BRUNO EDUARDO LOBO/S-1897-2019| Passos, Fabiana/L-1432-2016;Aquino, Sergio F./0000-0001-6058-3218| Passos, Fabiana/0000-0001-7501-988X| Baeta, Bruno/0000-0003-4087-4936| Lobo Baeta, Bruno/0000-0003-2327-0559;Minas Gerais State Research Funding Agency (FAPEMIG)Minas Gerais State Research Foundation (FAPEMIG)| National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) from the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation;Authors want to thank Mr. Arbib Zouhayr and Aqualia FCC (Spain) for providing the microalgal biomass and the Minas Gerais State Research Funding Agency (FAPEMIG) for the financial support.

Although Carbon Capture and Storage is the most mature route, it poses severe economic penalty to power generation. Alternatively, this penalty is potentially reduced by Carbon Capture and Utilization, which converts carbon dioxide to valuable products, monetizing it. This work evaluates a route consisting of carbon dioxide bio-capture by Chlorella pyrenoidosa and use of the resulting biomass as feedstock to a microalgae-based biorefinery| Carbon Capture and Storage route is evaluated as a reference technology. The integrated arrangement comprises: (a) carbon dioxide bio-capture in a photobioreactor, (b) oil extraction from part of the produced biomass, (b) gasification of remaining biomass to obtain bio-syngas, and (c) conversion of bio-syngas to methanol. Calculation of capital and operational expenditures are estimated based on mass and energy balances obtained by process simulation for both routes (Carbon Capture and Storage and the biorefinery). Capital expenditure for the biorefinery is higher by a factor of 6.7, while operational expenditure is lower by a factor of 0.45 and revenues occur only for this route, with a ratio revenue/operational expenditure of 1.6. The photobioreactor is responsible for one fifth of the biorefinery capital expenditure, with footprint of about 1000 ha, posing the most significant barrier for technical and economic feasibility of the proposed biorefinery. The Biorefinery and Carbon Capture and Storage routes show carbon dioxide capture efficiency of 73% and 48%, respectively, with capture cost of 139$/t and 304$/t. Additionally, the biorefinery has superior performance in all evaluated metrics of environmental impacts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, microalgae anaerobic digestion can be enhanced by applying pretreatment techniques. The aim of this study is to improve the biogas production from microalgal biomass grown in urban wastewater treatment systems by applying an enzymatic pretreatment with crude fungal broth and commercial laccase. To this end, the fungus Trametes versicolor was cultured, and the enzymatic activity of the culture broth analysed by measuring laccase concentration. The results showed that both the fungal broth and commercial laccase pretreatment (100 U L-1) over an exposure time of 20 min increased the methane yield in batch tests. Indeed, the fungal broth pretreatment increased the methane yield by 74%, while commercial laccase increased the methane yield by 20% as compared to non-pretreated microalgal biomass. In this manner, laccase addition enhanced microalgal biomass anaerobic biodegradability, and addition of T. versicolor broth further improved the results. This fact may be attributed to the presence of other molecules excreted by the fungus. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Influence of temperature, photon flux density, nitrate concentration and light regime on specific growth rate, biomass productivity and phycoerythrin content was investigated. The microalga was batch-cultured in f/2 media at photon flux densities of 15, 50 and 150 mu mol photons . m(-2) . s(-1) and temperatures of 20, 26 and 32 degrees C. At each quantum irradiance, increasing temperatures resulted in a decrease in the maximum growth rate. Additionally, the growth rate observed at all temperatures increased with photon flux density from 15 to 50 or to 150 mu mol photons . m(-2) . s(-1). Phycoerythrin content was inversely related to photon flux density, whereas pigment content increased with growth temperature from 20 to 26 degrees C. Response surface methodology confirmed that cultivating Rhodomonas at 26 degrees C and 15 mu mol photons . m(-2) . s(-1) optimizes phycoerythrin production. In addition, accumulation of biliprotein was stimulated by a 25% increase in nitrate concentration in the culture medium. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The algae's ability to remove nutrients from wastewater and the oleaginous potential of the algae's biomass were also evaluated. Total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen were measured. The photobioreactor consisted of a system of three acrylic tubes, a reservoir, connections and a CO2 supply. The gas supply was semicontinuous with CO2 added from a cylinder. The culture's growth was estimated from cell numbers counted on a daily basis. Lipid content in the biomass was analysed using gas chromatography. A maximum cell density of 9.11x10(6)cellsmL(-1) and a dry weight of 234.00mgL(-1) were obtained during cultivation without CO2, and these values rose to 42.48x10(6)cellsmL(-1) and 1277.44mgL(-1), respectively, when CO2 was added to the cultivation. Differences in the quality of the effluent and the presence of CO2 did not result in different lipid profiles. The presence of palmitic acid and oleic acid was notable.

The vast and expanding collection of experimental data on both cell growth and biomass composition available in the literature can be used to reduce the cost of the experimental investigations required to support process engineering and optimization. Selecting the appropriate organism requires extracting useful information from such data, a cumbersome task since various multidisciplinary factors must be considered. This paper presents a computer-aided methodology for selecting appropriate algal species given an energy or green chemical process application employing microalgae as a renewable raw material. The approach is systemoriented'', based on biomass composition and chemical processing of the biomass downstream of the CO2 biofixation and harvesting operations. Quantitative performance results are supported by professional process simulation. Besides comparison of a set of species performances, the proposed methodology also allows the discrimination among distinct algal compositions resulting from different growth conditions for a given species. Furthermore, three categories of screening metrics are proposed to be maximized by the decision making procedure in order to elicit the relevant information. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology, a databank of both biochemical and elemental compositions of microalgal biomass was used in three green applications: Assessment of biomass heating value| production of syngas by gasification of the biomass| and production of Bio-H-2. Within the accuracy of the databank employed to illustrate the procedure, the methodology selected Botryococcus braunii and Isochrysis galbana as potential promising candidates, for the three examined applications.;[Picardo, Marta C.| de Medeiros, Jose Luiz| Monteiro, Juliana Garcia M.| Fernandes Araujo, Ofelia de Queiroz] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Escola Quim, Dept Engn Quim, Ctr Tecnol, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil| [Chaloub, Ricardo Moreira] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Quim, Dept Bioquim, Ctr Tecnol, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil| [Giordano, Mario] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, I-60131 Ancona, Italy;Picardo, MC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Escola Quim, Dept Engn Quim, Ctr Tecnol, Av Horacio Macedo 2030,Bloco E,Sala 201, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;picardo@eq.ufrj.br| ofelia@eq.ufrj.br;Giordano, Mario/A-8949-2008| de Medeiros, Jose L./G-3342-2015| de Queiroz Fernandes Araujo, Ofelia/E-5247-2013| Monteiro, Juliana/ABG-1824-2020;Giordano, Mario/0000-0001-7754-0521| de Medeiros, Jose L./0000-0001-9099-4288| de Queiroz Fernandes Araujo, Ofelia/0000-0003-4041-7161| Monteiro, Juliana/0000-0002-2954-2466| CHALOUB, RICARDO/0000-0002-4042-951X;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [483140/2010-4, 551375/2010-8]| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento do Ensino Superior (CAPES)CAPES| Fundacao Carlos chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa de Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)| Fondazione Cariverona, ItalyFondazione Cariverona| Ministry for Agriculture and Forestry (MIPAF), Italy;M.

The hydrosoluble EPS fractions from mono- and co-cultures were characterized by A(1)A(3)C NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and compared. It was found that co-cultures resulted in the production of an EPS different from those produced by monocultures, showing fungal predominance with microalgal/cyanobacterial traces. Co-cultures conditions were screened (temperature, agitation speed, fungal and microalgae inoculation rate, initial pH, illumination rate, and glucose concentration) in order to achieve maximum biomass and EPS production, resulting in an increase of 33 and 61% in exopolysaccharides and biomass productions, respectively (patent pending).;[Angelis, S.| Novak, A.

However, low titers of secreted heterologous proteins are usually obtained, even with the most extensively studied microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, preventing their industrial application. In this study, we aimed to expand and evaluate secretory signal peptides (SP) for heterologous protein secretion in C. reinhardtii by comparing previously described SP with untested sequences. We compared the SPs from arylsulfatase 1 and carbonic anhydrase 1, with those of untried SPs from binding protein 1, an ice binding protein, and six sequences identified in silico. We identified over 2000 unique SPs using the SignalP 4.0 software. mCherry fluorescence was used to compare the protein secretion of up to 96 colonies for each construct, non-secretion construct, and parental wild type cc1690 cells. Supernatant fluorescence varied according to the SP used, with a 10-fold difference observed between the highest and lowest secretors. Moreover, two SPs identified in silico secreted the highest amount of mCherry. Our results demonstrate that the SP should be carefully selected and that efficient sequences can be coded in the C. reinhardtii genome. The SPs described here expand the portfolio available for research on heterologous protein secretion and for biomanufacturing applications.;[Dutra Molino, Joao Vitor| Monteiro de Carvalho, Joao Carlos] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Biochem & Pharmaceut Technol, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil| [Mayfield, Stephen Patrick] Univ Calif San Diego, Calif Ctr Algae Biotechnol, Div Biol Sci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA;Molino, JVD (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Biochem & Pharmaceut Technol, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.| Mayfield, SP (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Calif Ctr Algae Biotechnol, Div Biol Sci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.;molino@usp.br| smayfield@ucsd.edu;Molino, Joao Vitor/E-7516-2017;Molino, Joao Vitor/0000-0003-2475-9807;US Department of Energy Algae PEAK award [EE0008246]| Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/18224-2]| FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP);This work was supported by funding from the US Department of Energy Algae PEAK award EE0008246 (https://energy.gov/) (SM) and the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) grant 2013/18224-2 (http://www.fapesp.bren/) (JVDM).

The assessment was based on experimental results obtained over one year in pilot high rate algal ponds followed by anaerobic digesters for biogas production from harvested microalgal biomass and primary sludge. The energy balance compared four scenarios: 1) anaerobic co-digestion of microalgal biomass and primary sludge, and cogeneration from biogas in a combined with heat and power (CHP) unit| 2) co-digestion with thermal pretreatment of microalgal biomass, and cogeneration from biogas in a CHP unit| 3) co-digestion and heat generation from biogas in a boiler| and 4) co-digestion with thermal pretreatment of microalgal biomass, and heat generation from biogas in a boiler. According to the results, when biogas was used to cogenerate electricity and heat (scenarios 1 and 2), the electricity balance was always positive, and the best results were obtained with pretreated microalgal biomass (scenario 2). Similarly, the heat balance was always positive when biomass was thermally pretreated (scenario 2). On the other hand, when biogas was only used to produce heat (scenarios 3 and 4), heat requirements were covered during the whole year. The sensibility analysis of the scenarios with pretreatment (2 and 4) confirmed that the microalgae-based WWTP would be energy neutral or even net energy producer.;[Passos, Fabiana| Gutierrez, Raquel| Uggetti, Enrica| Garfi, Marianna| Garcia, Joan| Ferrer, Ivet] Univ Politecn Catalunya BarcelonaTech, GEMMA Grp Environm Engn & Microbiol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Bldg D1, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain| [Passos, Fabiana] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Sanit & Environm Engn, Antonio Carlos Ave 6627, BR-31270090 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil;Uggetti, E (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Catalunya BarcelonaTech, GEMMA Grp Environm Engn & Microbiol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Bldg D1, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain.;enrica.uggetti@upc.edu;Passos, Fabiana/L-1432-2016| Garcia, Joan/ABD-7251-2020| Garfi, Marianna/ABD-9662-2020| Ferrer, Ivet/L-4457-2014| Uggetti, Enrica/K-6829-2014;Passos, Fabiana/0000-0001-7501-988X| Garcia, Joan/0000-0003-1258-8174| Ferrer, Ivet/0000-0002-4568-4843| Uggetti, Enrica/0000-0001-6919-485X;Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through project BIOALGAS [CTM2010-17846]| Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through project DIPROBIO [CTM2012-37860]| Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through project FOTOBIOGAS [CTQ2014-57293-C3-3R]| Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [IJCI-2014-21594]|  [2013FI_B 01096];This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the projects BIOALGAS (CTM2010-17846), DIPROBIO (CTM2012-37860) and FOTOBIOGAS (CTQ2014-57293-C3-3R).

The starting biomass had a total lipid content of 7.0% (Folch method), comprised mainly by the following fatty acids: 16: 0 (44.2%), 18: 3 (n-6) (23.3%), and 18: 2 (n-6) (11.1%). When the transesterification reaction was carried out without ultrasound, it only extracted 12.8% of lipids (0.9% of the biomass) after 2 h of reaction, achieving only a 63.6% ester content. When the process was carried out under the same conditions except for the ultrasound-assisted (80 W), the weight yield remained mostly unchanged, but the ester content increased to 97.6%. Additionally, when chloroform was added to methanol as a co-solvent in a 2: 1 ratio it was possible to extract 43% of lipids. However, the ester content was reduced to 69.7%. Moreover, with maximum ultrasound power (180 W) a high ester content (96.9%) and a relatively high extraction yield (26%) were obtained, even without the co-solvent. These results show that the ultrasound significant increased the yield of the in-situ alkaline transesterification of Spirulina sp. biomass, promoting a higher percent recovery of lipids as well as ester content from the starting material.

The physiological responses and cell wall features of two putatively contrasting lichen-forming microalgae, Trebouxia sp. TR9 (TR9), isolated from Ramalina farinacea (adapted to frequent desiccation-rehydration cycles), and Coccomyxa solorina-saccatae (Csol), obtained from Solorina saccata (growing in usually humid limestone crevices, subjected to seasonal dry periods) was characterized. Microalgal cultures were desiccated under 25%-30% RH and then rehydrated. Under these conditions, RWC and psi(w) decreased faster and simultaneously during dehydration in Csol, whereas TR9 maintained its psi(w) until 70% RWC. The metabolic profile indicated that polyols played a key role in DT of both microalgae. However, TR9 constitutively accumulated higher amounts of polyols, whereas Csol induced the polyol synthesis under desiccation-rehydration. Csol also accumulated ascorbic acid, while TR9 synthesized protective raffinose-family oligosaccharides (RFOs) and increased its content of phenolics. Additionally, TR9 exhibited thicker and qualitatively different cell wall and extracellular polymeric layer compared with Csol, indicating higher water retention capability. The findings were consistent with the notion that lichen microalgae would have evolved distinct strategies to cope with desiccation-rehydration stress in correspondence with the water regime of their respective habitats.;[Centeno, Danilo C.] Fed Univ ABC, Ctr Nat Sci & Humanities, BR-09606070 Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil| [Centeno, Danilo C.| Hell, Aline F.| Braga, Marcia R.] Inst Bot, Dept Plant Physiol & Biochem, BR-04301912 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil| [del Campo, Eva M.| Casano, Leonardo M.] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Life Sci, Alcala De Henares 28805, Madrid, Spain;Casano, LM (corresponding author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Life Sci, Alcala De Henares 28805, Madrid, Spain.;leonardo.casano@uah.es;Hell, Aline Forgatti/AAN-7435-2020| Casano, Leonardo M.

Other objectives are as follows: (i) to compare the impact of various raw materials, substances, and services| and (ii) to evaluate environment-relevant aspects of the proposed system as compared to microalgae raceway ponds. The life cycle inventory assessment shows that (i) only atmospheric CO2 is used for PBR microalgae cultivation, whereas in raceway ponds, injection of CO2 from fossil origin is largely required to allow for microalgae growth| and (ii) the PBR daily production rate of dry biomass is currently at 1.5 kg m(-3) day(-1) for each PBR, which is 12.82 times larger than the reported average 0.117 kg m(-3) day(-1) race-way ponds production. It is found that in general the association of the effects of the production of steel, PVC, and the packaging contribute to more than 85% of the total impact in each analyzed category. Therefore, to achieve PBR biomass production impact reduction and sustainability, PVC and steel utilization need to be minimized, as well as packaging materials. Based on the PBR LCA results, that is, due to no CO2 injection from fossil origin and low area occupation, it is expected that high density production of truly renewable microalgae biomass could be obtained from PBR systems.;[Silva, Angela G.| Carter, Richard| Ordonez, Juan C.] Florida State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA| [Silva, Angela G.| Carter, Richard| Ordonez, Juan C.] Florida State Univ, Ctr Adv Power Syst, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA| [Merss, Felipe L.

Two cultivation technologies are taken into account: the open raceway pond and the flat panel photobioreactor. For each technology, the model is able to evaluate the microalgae areal and volumetric productivity and the energy production and consumption. Differently from the most common existing models in literature, which deal with a specific part of the overall cultivation process, the model presented here includes all physical and chemical quantities that mostly affect microalgae growth: the equation of the specific growth rate for the microalgae is influenced by CO2 and nutrients concentration in the water, light intensity, temperature of the water in the reactor, and by the microalgae species being considered. All these input parameters can be tuned to obtain reliable predictions. A comparison with experimental data taken from the literature shows that the predictions are consistent and slightly overestimating the productivity in the case of closed photobioreactor. The results obtained by the simulation runs are consistent with those found in literature, being the areal productivity for the open raceway pond between 50 and 70 t/(ha x year) in Southern Spain (Sevilla) and Brazil (Petrolina) and between 250 and 350 t/ (ha x year) for the flat panel photobioreactor in the same locations.;[Marsullo, Matteo| Manente, Giovanni| Lazzaretto, Andrea] Univ Padua, Dept Ind Engn, Via Venezia 1, I-35131 Padua, Italy| [Mian, Alberto| Ensinas, Adriano Viana| Marechal, Francois] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, IPESE Grp, Lausanne, Switzerland| [Ensinas, Adriano Viana] Univ Fed ABC, Santo Andre, Brazil;Lazzaretto, A (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Ind Engn, Via Venezia 1, I-35131 Padua, Italy.;andrea.lazzaretto@unipd.it;Marechal, Francois M.

Experiments were conducted with cultures in the logarithmic and stationary growth phases. The low-charge FLOPAM (R) FO 4240 SH was the most effective at concentrations of 2 and 4 mg m(-3) in the LOG phase cultures, with flocculation efficiencies >90%. Smaller flocculation efficiencies were observed for cells in the stationary growth phase, most likely due to the production of dissolved organic carbon by the microalga. The highest microalgae density generated higher flocculation rates, whereas the pH and salinity negatively impacted flocculant efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Five mathematical growth models (logistic, Gompertz, modified Gompertz, Baranyi, and Morgan) were used to estimate the biomass productivity in continuous processes and to predict the following parameters of cell growth: lag phase duration, maximum specific growth rate and maximum cell concentration. The results demonstrated that the addition of 25% of the salts (w/v) in the BGN medium to wastewater favors microalgae growth. Using statistical and physiological significance criteria, the modified Gompertz model was considered the most appropriate for quantifying biomass growth. The model prediction analysis shows the possibility to obtain 1.41 kg(biomass)/L-reactor in 1000 h of continuous processing with a consequent biofixation of 2.61 kg(CO2)/L-reactor.

The water in Mangueira Lagoon (Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil) has several required nutrients for the growth of Spirulina and could be added to culture medium to reduce the cost of producing S. platensis. Although little studied, repeated batch cultivation is a very useful technique because it has a better cost-benefit ratio than other cultivation methods. In a series of runs, we studied the influence of cell concentration, renewal rate and strain on the specific growth rate and biomass productivity of S. platensis during repeated batch cultivation, the runs taking place in 2-1 Erlenmeyer flasks for 2160 h at 30 degrees C and a light intensity of 2500 lux under a 12 h photoperiod. The three factors studied had a significant (P < 0.05) effect on the results (specific growth rate and productivity). Using Zarrouk's medium, the highest specific growth rate (mu(x)) was 0.111 day(-1) while the biomass productivity (P-x) was 0.0423 g l(-1) day(-1), while Mangueira Lagoon water supplemented with 10% Zarrouk's medium gave mu(x) = 0.113 day(-1) and a productivity P-x = 0.0467 g l(-1) day(-1). These values were two to three times higher than the results obtained in batch cultivation, indicating that the repeated batch cultivation of S. platensis is attractive and convenient.;Fundacao Univ Fed Rio Grande, Biochem Engn Lab, Dept Chem, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil| Univ Passo Fundo, Lab Fermentat, BR-99001970 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil;Costa, JAV (corresponding author), Fundacao Univ Fed Rio Grande, Biochem Engn Lab, Dept Chem, Alfredo Huch 475,POB 474, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.;dqmjorge@furg.br;Reinehr, Christian O/G-4608-2013| Costa, Jorge A V/L-3999-2013;Reinehr, Christian O/0000-0002-4710-3635| Costa, Jorge A V/0000-0001-8042-7642;;;;26;19;19;1;8;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0959-3993;1573-0972;;WORLD J MICROB BIOT;World J.

During ten days of batch cultivation, daily determinations of pH, cell number, enzymatic activity, and total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), as well as its main species, CO2 and HCO3, were performed. Enzymatic activity increased as the growing cell population depleted inorganic carbon from the medium. Carbon dioxide concentration decreased quickly, especially in the third day Of Cultivation, when a significant increase of the intracellular enzymatic activity was observed. Bicarbonate concentration had its largest decrease in the cultivation medium in the fourth day, when the activity of the extracellular enzyme had its largest increase, suggesting its use by the alga through CA activity. After the fourth cultivation day, half of the cultures were aerated with CO2-free atmospheric air, which caused an increase in the total and external activity of the enzyme, although, in this condition, the stationary growth phase began earlier than in cultures aerated with atmospheric air. The pH of the media was measured daily, increasing from the first to the fourth day, and remaining almost constant until the end of the cultivation.

However, costs incurred by cultivating them make it an expensive process. The combination of wastewater treatment and microalgae cultivation is a viable option to reduce expenses related to cultivation. However, municipal wastewater from the centralized Brazilian sanitation system is highly diluted, and it is technically and economically impractical to use it for microalgae cultivation. As an alternative, diluted effluent can be mixed with a different kind of wastewater, aiming to increase the nutrient concentration (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) for microalgae cultivation. In this study, microalgae cultivation and wastewater mixture (municipal and piggery wastewater) treatment were monitored for four weeks. The pilot treatment system consisted of UASB as pretreatment and Chlorella sorokiniana cultivation in three flat panel photobioreactors. High UASB efficiency was obtained in organic matter removal (> 90%), even with a large variability of initial mixture characteristics. C. sorokiniana production reached about 1 g L-1, with an average removal of dissolved inorganic carbon, orthophosphate and ammonia around 46 to 56%, 40 to 60% and 100%, respectively.

It comprises the co-digestion of microalgae with primary sludge, the thermal pretreatment (75 degrees C for 10 h) of microalgae and the role of the hydraulic retention time (HRT) in anaerobic digesters. Initially, a batch test comparing different microalgae (untreated and pretreated) and primary sludge proportions showed how the co-digestion improved the AD kinetics. The highest methane yield was observed by adding 75% of primary sludge to pretreated microalgae (339 mL CH4/g VS). This condition was then investigated in mesophilic lab-scale reactors. The average methane yield was 0.46 L CH4/g VS, which represented a 2.9-fold increase compared to pretreated microalgae mono-digestion. Conversely, microalgae showed a low methane yield despite the thermal pretreatment (0.16 L CH4/g VS). Indeed, microscopic analysis confirmed the presence of microalgae species with resistant cell walls (i.e., Stigioclonium sp. and diatoms). In order to improve their anaerobic biodegradability, the HRT was increased from 20 to 30 days, which led to a 50% methane yield increase. Overall, microalgae AD was substantially improved by the co-digestion with primary sludge, even without pretreatment, and increasing the HRT enhanced the AD of microalgae with resistant cell walls.;[Sole-Bundo, Maria| Garfi, Marianna| Ferrer, Ivet] Univ Politecn Cataluna, GEMMA Grp Environm Engn & Microbiol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, BarcelonaTech, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Bldg D1, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain| [Salvado, Humbert] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Evolutionary Biol Ecol & Environm Sci, Ave Diagonal 643, Barcelona 08007, Spain| [Passos, Fabiana] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Sanit & Environm Engn, Antonio Carlos Ave 6627, BR-31270090 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil;Ferrer, I (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, GEMMA Grp Environm Engn & Microbiol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, BarcelonaTech, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Bldg D1, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain.;maria.sole-bundo@upc.edu| hsalvado@ub.edu| fabiana@desa.ufmg.br| marianna.garfi@upc.edu| ivet.ferrer@upc.edu;Sole-Bundo, Maria/AAH-2666-2020| Passos, Fabiana/L-1432-2016| Garfi, Marianna/ABD-9662-2020| Salvado, Humbert/L-6519-2014| Ferrer, Ivet/L-4457-2014;Passos, Fabiana/0000-0001-7501-988X| Salvado, Humbert/0000-0002-4678-2103| Sole-Bundo, Maria/0000-0001-9657-6095| Ferrer, Ivet/0000-0002-4568-4843;Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [FOTOBIOGAS CTQ2014-57293-C3-3-R]| Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.BarcelonaTech;This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (project FOTOBIOGAS CTQ2014-57293-C3-3-R).

In contrast, there was a low lipid extraction of 0.21 mg of lipids/mg of biomass and 0.12-0.23 mg of protein/mg of biomass in the coagulation-flocculation process.

Therefore, biodegradable packaging has been attracting attention and interest from researchers and industries worldwide. This work developed biodegradable films with antioxidant properties, using cassava starch combined with biomass or biomass extract of microalgae Heterochlorella luteoviridis and Dunaliella tertiolecta. The films were characterized by their physicochemical, mechanical, barrier, optical and antioxidant properties. The film with the best characteristics was used as salmon packaging aiming protection against lipid oxidation. In general, the addition of biomass increased films' solubility, biodegradability and opacity, while the films with the addition of biomass extract showed the lowest values of these parameters. The addition of biomass increased films' elongation, rupture, and reduced the tensile strength and Young's modulus. Conversely, the addition of microalgae extract caused the inverse effect on these properties. All films with microalgae showed higher antioxidant activity, evaluated by peroxide index, compared to the control ones. The film containing 2.0% of H. luteoviridis extract presented the lowest water vapor permeability and good mechanical characteristics, and was applied in salmon packaging. The selected packaging decreased fish moisture and delayed lipid oxidation evaluated by TBARS index. The results showed incorporation of microalgae biomass resulted in biodegradable and highly soluble films, making it difficult to apply in moist foods. The films containing microalgae extracts were suitable to be used in foods with high water content.;[Carissimi, Mariel| Flores, Simone Hickmann| Rech, Rosane] Fed Univ Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Inst Food Sci & Technol, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil;Rech, R (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Inst Food Sci & Technol, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.;rrech@ufrgs.br;Rech, Rosane/L-3703-2013;Rech, Rosane/0000-0002-3053-0091| Flores, Simone/0000-0002-5320-3448;;;;33;18;19;2;19;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2211-9264;;;ALGAL RES;Algal Res.;JUN;2018;32;;;;;;201;209;;10.1016/j.algal.2018.04.001;;;9;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;GG4FE;WOS:000432649800022;;;;;2021-01-01

Among the chlorophytes, Chlorella sp. (D101Z) stood out as having the greatest daily cell division rate (2.42 d(-1)). Among the cyanobacteria examined, the species Synechocystis sp. (M3C) and Synechococcus nidulans (D109WC) showed elevated lipid (54.2 and 93.8 mg L-1 d(-1) respectively) and biomass productivities (0.39 and 0.69 g L-1 d(-1) respectively). The lipids produced by the chlorophytes were mainly saturated, monounsaturated, and triunsaturated esters, while the cyanobacteria produced high levels of saturated esters and fatty acids with different degrees of unsaturation. Statistical analyses indicated D101Z and D109WC as promising species, as they showed high lipid productivity and the biodiesel produced from their lipids demonstrated low cold filter clogging point values, with a low iodine index for D101Z| the rather high iodine index of D109WC, however, disqualified it for biodiesel production purposes. Among the species studied, only the chlorophyte Monoraphidium contortum (D173WC) and the cyanobacteria D109WC did not meet all of the quality specifications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Magnetic fields of 5, 30 and 60 mT generated by electric current and ferrite magnets were applied at different lengths of time. The magnetic field of 30 and 60 mT for 1 h d(-1) stimulated the growth, thus leading to higher biomass concentration by comparison with the control culture. Increase in productivity, protein and carbohydrate contents were 105.1% (60 mT for 1 h d(-1)), 16.6% (60 mT for 24 h d(-1)) and 133.2% (30 mT for 24 h d(-1)), respectively. These values were higher than the ones of the control.

In this context, microalgae are widely recognized for their potential to capture and biochemically convert CO2, with promising applications as raw material for a variety of products. Therefore, the energy penalty conventionally presented by CCS (carbon capture and storage) could be replaced by an alternative that offers added revenues, the biorefinery. The productive arrangement is approached from a process engineering standpoint and relies on sustainability metrics to assess environmental and economic performance. The work presents a sustainability assessment procedure, applied to tracking sustainability of alternative routes for mitigating CO2 emitted by a NGCC (natural gas combined cycle) power plant, a post-combustion capture concept. The evaluated CO2 destination routes are: a) cultivation of microalgae with flue gas, harvesting of microalgae and downstream processing of biomass to a chemical commodity (ammonia), evaluating the possibility of recycling part of the intermediary syngas stream as renewable fuel to the gas turbine| and b) CO2 capture by chemical absorption, followed by compression and storage steps. The proposed Sustainability Degree indicates biofixation of CO2 with total conversion of syngas to ammonia as the most sustainable among the evaluated alternatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TR9 are the two microalgae that coexist within Ramalina farinacea thalli. In the presence of Pb, TR9 formed extracellular aggregates, while TR1 showed a lower wall lead retention capability. Herein, we studied the cell walls and extracellular polymers (EPS) of TR1 and TR9, and their possible implication in the different Pb retention capacity of these microalgae. The proportion of cell walls on the overall cell biomass was 2.6 times higher in TR9 than in TR1. Glycosyl linkage analysis indicated the presence of hot-water soluble beta-galactofuranan(s) in both cell walls, distinct from that previously described in Asterochloris, with increased rhamnose content in TR9 and a higher substitution by side chains in TR1. In the EPS of both microalgae, monosaccharide composition resembled their cell walls| however, TR9 produced two times more EPS than TR1. EPS also contained proteins, displaying distinct polypeptide patterns, modulated by Pb in TR9. Uronic acid content in EPS was higher in TR9, and increased in this phycobiont after the addition of Pb. Our findings suggest that the differential extracellular Pb retention capabilities of TR1 and TR9 microalgae can be related to differences in the main features of their cell walls and EPS.

Aiming to facilitate the identification of polluted or contaminated areas, the study of microalga Lingulodinium polyedrum in phenol-containing medium comprises the determination of toxic and metabolic phenol effects, featuring a possible use of this microorganism as bioindicator for this pollutant Marine microalga L. polyedrum exposure to phenol increases superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. The 20% and 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC20 and IC50) of cells exposed to phenol were 40 mu mol L-1 and 120 mu mol L-1, respectively. Phenol biodegradation by L. polyedrum was 0.02 mu mol h(-1) cell(-1), and its biotransformation was catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase (GST), phenol hydroxylase and catechol 2,3-dihydroxygenase metabolic pathways. Phenol exposure produced the metabolites 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde acid, 1,2-dihydroxybenzene (catechol), and 2-oxo-4-pentenoic acid| also, it induced the activity of key antioxidant biomarker enzymes SOD and CAT by three folds compared to that in the controls. Further, phenol decreased the glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG), highlighting the effective glutathione oxidation in L. polyedrum. Overall, our results suggest that phenol alters microalga growth conditions and microalgae are sensitive bioindicators to pollution by phenol in marine environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of stormwater runoff sampled during two rain events were determined by exposing S. subspicatus cells to different concentrations (% v:v) of each sample. The effects were measured as the percentage change in growth rates in relation to a control culture after exposure times of 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. The runoff from the first rain event had no negative effects to S. subspicatus, posing in most cases growth stimulation, whereas the runoff from the second rain event inhibited algae growth. Differences in runoff physico-chemical characteristics combined with the hydrological factors of each rain event explained these opposite effects. The hypothesis of toxic first flush phenomenon was confirmed in the second rain event on the basis of normalized inhibitory effects and runoff volume. It was found that 42, 51 and 50% of the inhibitory effects during exposures of 24,48 and 72 h were associated with the initial 4% of the total discharged volume. The fact that negative effects were observed in the two runoff events analyzed, raises concern about the potential environmental threats posed by runoff originated from wood-based industrial areas during the entire hydrological year.

Despite this, their use as biodiesel feedstock is limited by their slow growth, which increases production costs. B. braunii wastewater bioremediation power, however, may be able to overcome this problem. This research evaluated the performance of two strains (UTEX-USA and IBL-Brazil) grown in pre-treated (influent) and treated (effluent) wastewater. The goal was to optimize algal-productivity and wastewater treatment in order to provide biomass rich in high-quality oil for biodiesel. The standard CHU-medium was used as control. Phosphorus was 100% removed in all treatments for both strains. Nitrogen removal was higher in wastewater (61-65%) than in CHU medium (48 and 61%), respectively for UTEX and IBL strains. Cultivation in the effluent generated higher biomass and lipid productivity for the UTEX strain, while the influent was the best for the IBL strain. The composition of the fatty-acids produced by Botryococcus was used to estimate the biodiesel quality. Hence, the biodiesels may have good fuel quality (high ignition and combustion efficiency) but limited application at low temperatures. The composition of fatty-acids, however, can be optimized by growing or mixing strategies. Therefore, Botryococcus braunii is a potential source for high quality biodiesel production.;[Rinna, Francesca| Buono, Silvia| Sansone, Giovanni| Assunta Barone, Carmela Maria] Univ Naples Federico II, Acquaculture Div, CAISIAL, Parco Gussone, I-80055 Portici, NA, Italy| [Cabanelas, Iago Teles Dominguez| Sansone, Giovanni| Assunta Barone, Carmela Maria] Wageningen Univ, Bioproc Engn, Wageningen, Netherlands| [Nascimento, Iracema Andrade| Sansone, Giovanni| Assunta Barone, Carmela Maria] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, LABIOMAR, Campus Ondina, Salvador, Ba, Brazil| [Sansone, Giovanni| Assunta Barone, Carmela Maria] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Biol Sci, Via Mezzocannone 16, Naples, Italy| [Assunta Barone, Carmela Maria] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr, I-80055 Portici, NA, Italy;Barone, CMA (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Acquaculture Div, CAISIAL, Parco Gussone, I-80055 Portici, NA, Italy.;carmela.barone@unina.it;Assunta, Barone Carmela Maria/AAD-5231-2019| Nascimento, Iracema A/L-5069-2015;Assunta, Barone Carmela Maria/0000-0003-0433-0712| ;CNR (Italy)Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)| CNPQ (Brazil)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [303296/2011-9];This paper was carried out as a Brazil/Italy collaboration and both countries are represented by the authors' Institutions.

In this study, the effects of carbofuran and diuron and their mixtures on the microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata were investigated. For this purpose, toxicity tests were performed with the single compounds (active ingredients and commercial formulations) and their combinations (only active ingredients). According to the results, the toxicity of active ingredients and their commercial formulations to R. subcapitata was similar. In the single exposures, both carbofuran and diuron inhibited significantly the it subcapitntn growth and caused physiological (chlorophyll a content) and morphological (complexity and cell size) changes in cells, as captured by flow cytometry single-cell properties. Regarding the mixture toxicity tests, data fitted to both reference models, concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA), and evidenced significant deviations. After the CA fitting, dose-ratio dependent deviation had the best fit to the data, demonstrating synergism caused mainly by diuron and antagonism caused mainly by carbofuran. After fitting the IA model, a synergistic deviation represented the best fit for the diuron and carbofuran mixtures. In general, the two reference models indicated the occurrence of synergism in the mixtures of these compounds, especially when diuron was the dominant chemical in the combinations. The increased toxicity caused by the mixture of these pesticides could pose a greater environmental risk for phytoplankton. Thus, exposure to diuron and carbofuran mixtures must also be considered in risk assessments, since the combination of these compounds may result in more severe effects on algae population growth than single exposures.;[Mansano, Adrislaine S.| Moreira, Raquel A.| Dornfeld, Hugo C.| Freitas, Emanuela C.| Rocha, Odete| Seleghim, Mirna H.

J;Borges, L| Caldas, S| D'Oca, MGM| Abreu, PC;Borges, Lucelia| Caldas, Sergiane| Montes D'Oca, Marcelo G.| Abreu, Paulo Cesar;Effect of harvesting processes on the lipid yield and fatty acid profile of the marine microalga Nannochloropsis oculata;AQUACULTURE REPORTS;English;Article;Microalgae harvesting| Polyunsaturated fatty acid| Lipid| EPA;;The effect of different methods of biomass concentration and salt removal on the lipid yield and fatty acid profile of the marine microalga Nannochloropsis oculata was evaluated. The microalgae were subjected to nine treatments: (1) centrifugation, (2) centrifugation + washing with H2O, (3) centrifugation + washing with ammonium formate, (4) flocculation with NaOH, (5) flocculation with NaOH + washing with H2O, (6) flocculation with NaOH + washing with ammonium formate, (7) flocculation with NaOH and neutralization with HCl, (8) flocculation with NaOH, neutralization with HCl+ washing with H2O, and (9) flocculation with NaOH, neutralization with HCl+ washing with ammonium formate. Flocculation with the addition of NaOH was effective at concentrating biomass (>90%) but interfered with lipid extraction because it exhibited a lower lipid yield (4.40 +/- 0.1%) compared with centrifugation (45.4 +/- 0.8%). Moreover, important polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA C20:5) and eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA C20:4), disappeared when NaOH was used. Centrifugation plus washing the biomass with ammonium formate was more effective than other treatments, leading to higher lipid yields, as well as larger amounts of the polyunsaturated fatty acids EPA and ETA. However, it is a very expensive harvesting method. Thus, the main finding of the present study is that microalgae concentration processes can affect lipid and fatty acid extraction in massive microalgae production| therefore, it is necessary to carefully choose the harvest process to be used in large-scale microalgae production.

Results indicated that alkaline and thermal pretreatment contributed mostly to glycoprotein and pectin solubilisation| whilst acid pretreatment solubilised mostly hemicellulose, with lower effectiveness for proteins. Regarding the anaerobic biodegradability, biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests showed that final methane yield was enhanced after almost all pretreatment conditions when compared to non-pretreated microalgae, with the highest increase for thermochemical pretreatment at the lowest dose (0.5%), i.e. 82% and 86% increase for alkaline and acid, respectively. At higher doses, salt toxicity was revealed by K+ concentrations over 5000 mg/L. All BMP data from pretreated biomass was successfully described by the modified Gompertz model and optimal condition (thermochemical 0.5% HCl) showed an increase in final methane yield and the process kinetics.

Trying to overcome energy-costs, this research analyzed the biodiesel production system via dry-route, based on Chlorella vulgaris cultivated in race-ways, by comparing the GHG-footprints of diverse microalgae-biodiesel scenarios. These involved: the single system of biomass production (C0)| the application of pyrolysis on the residual microalgal biomass (cake) from the oil extraction process (C1)| the same as C0, with anaerobic cake co-digested with cattle manure (C2)| the same conditions as in C1 and C2, by integrating in both cases (respectively C3 and C4), the microalgae cultivation with an autonomous ethanol distillery. The reduction of GHG emissions in scenarios with no such integration (C1 and C2), compared to CO, was insignificant (0.53% and 4.67%, respectively), whereas in the scenarios with integration with ethanol production system, the improvements were 53.57% for C3 and 63.84% for C4.

The reduction of nutrient availability in culture media, especially nitrogen, stresses the microorganisms and affects cell growth, thus inducing lipid accumulation. This is an interesting step in biodiesel feedstock obtention from microalgae and should be better understood. In this study, four levels of nitrogen concentration in the BG-11 culture medium were evaluated in the growth of the chlorophycean microalga Desmodesmus sp. Both cell growth and lipid content were monitored over 7 days of cultivation, which yielded a final cell density of 33 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) with an initial NaNO3 concentration of 750 mg L-1 in the medium and a maximum lipid content of 23 % with total nitrogen starvation. It was observed that the microalgae presented high lipid accumulation in the fourth day of cultivation with nitrogen starvation, although with moderate cell growth.;[Rios, L. F.| Klein, B.

Previous studies of the transport function and permeation of molecules through the algae capsules were done using the algae Spondylosium panduriforme and Nephrocytium lunatum, the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) technique, and different spin labels. The results suggested that the capsule functions as a selective diffusion medium. In the present work charged and uncharged molecules (spin labels group A) and Staurastrum iversenii var. americanum (Desmids),whose alga presents a great mucilaginous capsule, were used. Charged nitroxide molecules similar to amino acids (spin labels group B) were also used allowing a better understanding of the electrostatic effect in the permeation process across the capsule. The role of the cell capsule in the solute diffusion was evaluated by determining the capsulated and decapsulated cell permeation times. The permeation times for all spin labels tested in the cells lacking capsules were always shorter than those containing this physical barrier. The decay times of spin labels group A observed for S. iversenii were compared to other studied algae. The results regarding the diffusion of charged spin labels group B Suggested that the interaction of cell capsule occurs more strongly with negatively charged molecules than with positively charged ones. The results obtained in this work with spin labels group A confirm that the capsule is an essential structure for the cell, and that due to the polar interactions with the spin labels, it plays an important role in the selection of small molecules. Several parameters, mainly those of electrostatic nature, seem to control the permeation across the algal capsules of spin labels group B, showing that structures which are similar to amino acids could diffuse across the interior of the algal cell.;USP, Inst Fis Sao Carlos, Dept Fis & Informat, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Bot, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Biofis, BR-04044020 Sao Paulo, Brazil;Freire-Nordi, CS (corresponding author), USP, Inst Fis Sao Carlos, Dept Fis & Informat, Cx Postal 369, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;;Nakaie, Clovis R./B-3444-2014| Vieira, Armando AH/I-3894-2013;;;;;23;17;18;0;12;SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA FISICA;SAO PAULO;CAIXA POSTAL 66328, 05315-970 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL;0103-9733;;;BRAZ J PHYS;Braz.

LEB-18. The cellular growth of microalgae reduced with the use of limited nitrogen medium, demonstrating that nitrogen deficiency interferes with the metabolism of microorganisms and the production of biomass. The biochemical composition of microalgae was also altered, which was most notable in the degradation of proteins and chlorophylls and the accumulation of carbonaceous storage molecules such as lipids and polyhydroxyalkanoates. Chlorella minutissima did not produce these polymers even in a nitrogen deficient environment. The largest accumulations of the polyhydroxyalkanoates occurred after a 15 days culture, with a concentration of 16% (dry cell weight) produced by the Synechococcus subsalsus strain and 12% by Spirulina sp. LEB-18. Polyhydroxyalkanoates produced by Synechococcus subsalsus and Spirulina sp. LEB-18 presented different thermal and physical properties, indicating the influence of producing strain on polyhydroxyalkanoates properties. The polymers obtained consisted of long chain monomers with 14 to 18 carbon atoms. This composition is novel, as it has not previously been found in PHAs obtained from Synechococcus subsalsus and Spirulina sp. LEB-18. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The biomass was characterized by analytical techniques of Zeta Potential, FTIR, SEM, BET and BJH. The sorption experiments were performed using aqueous dye solutions of Acid Blue 161 (AB-161) and the equilibrium studies were carried out by variation in different parameters, i.e., pH (2-11), biosorbent dosage (0.005-0.040 g), contact time (0-540 min), temperature (25-40 degrees C) and dye concentration (200-1500 mg L-1). In the evaluation of the kinetic mechanism that controls the adsorption process examined at 200 and 400 mg L-1, it was observed that data fitted quite well with general order kinetic model. Freundlich isotherm model showed the best fit of the equilibrium data at boths experimental temperatures. The maximum amounts of AB-161 dye adsorbed were 75.78 mg g(-1) at 25 degrees C and 83.2 mg g(-1) at 40 degrees C. For treatment of real tannery wastewater, the results show that DMB significantly reduced the dye concentration (76.65%), TOC (50.78%) and TN (19.80%). From the thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption of AB-161 with DMB indicated a spontaneous endothermic process with a physical reaction by electrostatic interaction. Therefore, defatted microalgal biomass showed to be a promising material for adsorption of dye from tannery effluent.;[da Fontoura, Juliana Tolfo| Rolim, Guilherme Sebastiao| Mella, Bianca| Gutterres, Mariliz] Fed Univ Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Lab Leather & Environm Studies LACOURO, Chem Engn Postgrad Program PPGEQ, Av Luiz Englert S-N, BR-90040040 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil| [Farenzena, Marcelo] Fed Univ Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Lab Proc Control & Integrat LACIP, Chem Engn Postgrad Program PPGEQ, Av Luiz Englert S-N, BR-90040040 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil;da Fontoura, JT (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Lab Leather & Environm Studies LACOURO, Chem Engn Postgrad Program PPGEQ, Av Luiz Englert S-N, BR-90040040 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.;jutolfo@enq.ufrgs.br| mariliz@enq.ufrgs.br;Gutterres, Mariliz/H-7986-2016| Farenzena, Marcelo/AAI-5067-2020;Gutterres, Mariliz/0000-0001-8939-2888| ;Brazilian Federal Agency for the Scholarship (CAPES)CAPES| Financier of Studies and Projects (FINEP) [MCTI/FINEP CT-HIDRO 01/2013];We would like to thank to the scholarships provided by Brazilian Federal Agency for the Scholarship (CAPES) and to Financier of Studies and Projects (FINEP) - public call MCTI/FINEP CT-HIDRO 01/2013.;;52;16;17;1;15;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;;2213-3437;;J ENVIRON CHEM ENG;J.

The lipid fractions from Chlorella sp. using chloroform: methanol, methanol, and ethanol were obtained and the acid value measurements were 39.4, 58.2, and 82.5 mg KOH/g, respectively. Following this, transesterification of algal lipid extraction and direct transesterification was undertaken in the presence of ethanol and the results were compared with those for methanol. Apart from the lower yield in extracted lipids obtained with ethanol, when ethanol was used for transesterification of the algal lipid extraction, surprisingly, similar yields of fatty acid ethyl esters and fatty acid methyl esters were obtained. Furthermore, direct transesterification from Chlorella sp. provided higher ethyl and methyl esters yields than was the case with the extraction-transesterification process. Ethanol, a renewable feedstock, is the most sustainable alternative, which, compared to methanol in direct transesterification, resulted in similar fatty acid methyl and ethyl ester yields (11.6% and 11.0%, respectively, in the same experimental conditions).

In the present study, greenhouse gas emission, soil ammonia volatilization, and the growth of Pennisetum glaucum were evaluated under the effect of a microalgal biofilm, commercial urea, and a control (without application of a nitrogen source). CH4 emissions were equal for the three treatments (p> 0.05). CO2 emissions significantly increased in microalgal biofilm treatment (p < 0.01), which was also responsible for the highest N2O emissions (p < 0.01). The ammonia (N-NH3) volatilization losses were 4.63%, 18.98%, and 0.82% for the microalgal biofilm, urea, and control treatments, respectively. The main differences in soil characteristics were an increase in nitrogen and an increase in cation exchange capacity (p < 0.01) caused by the algal biomass application to the soil. The soil organic matter content significantly differed (p < 0.05) among the three treatments, with the microalgal biofilm treatment having the greatest increase in soil organic matter. Significant differences were observed for shoot dry matter mass and nitrogen content in the plants from both treatments where nitrogen sources were applied. All treatments differed from each other in leaf dry matter mass, with the urea treatment increasing the most. Chlorella vulgaris was the dominant microalgal specie in the soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, treatments to remove nitrogen are not efficient, so is necessary to develop alternative methods. The objective of this study is to investigate a consortium of microalgae - nitrifying, that due to the symbiosis between them could be an interesting alternative. Results: In this study, it was possible to obtain a consortium of nitrifying bacteria (NB) and microalgae (MA) capable of operating with low requirements of dissolved oxygen, using aerobic sludge from wastewater treatment plants. During the operation, this consortium presents removal percentages above 98% of ammonia, even at concentrations of DO of 0.5 mg O-2 L-1. It is estimated that the removal was caused both by the action of nitrifying bacteria and microalgae. It was determined that approximately 60% of the ammonia feed was oxidized to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria, while the algae assimilated 40% of the nitrogen feed at steady state. A methodology for measuring the specific activities of nitrifying bacteria and microalgae by comparing the rates in the variation inorganic nitrogen compounds was established with satisfactory results. An average specific activity of 0.05 and 0.02 g NH4+ gVSS(-1) d(-1) for nitrifying bacteria and microalgae was determined, respectively. Conclusions: The consortium it can be obtained in a single continuous operation, and has a high capacity for nitrogen removal with low oxygen content. The consortium could prove to be a more economical method compared to traditional. (C) 2016 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

This research aimed at monitoring the native community of microalgae and coliform bacteria in a secondary effluent from anaerobic municipal sewage treatment. Two treatments (aerated and non-aerated) were performed to grow microalgae under semi-controlled conditions in semi-closed photobioreactors in a greenhouse. The results showed no significant pH and coliforms (total and Escherichia coli) variation between treatments. Nutrient concentrations were reduced supporting microalgae growth up to 107 cells. mL(-1) independent of aeration. Exponential growth was obtained from the first day for the non-aerated, but a 5 day lag phase of growth was obtained for the aerated. Chlorella vulgaris was the dominant microalgae (99.9%) in both treatments. In the aerated, 5 algae classes were detected (Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Euglenophyceae), with 12 taxa, whereas in the non-aerated, 2 classes were identified (Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae), with 5 taxa. We concluded that effluent is viable for microalgae growth, especially Chlorella vulgaris, at the same time that the eutrophication potential and coliforms are decreased, contributing for better quality of the final effluent.;[Marchello, Adriano E.] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Hidrobiol, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| [Lombardi, Ana T.| Dellamano-Oliveira, Maria Jose] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Bot, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| [de Souza, Clovis W.

For that, a general transient mathematical model for managing microalgae derived hydrogen production, with temperature dependence of the cultivation medium is developed. The tool allows for the determination of the resulting whole system temperature, and mass fractions distribution. The simplified physical model combines principles of classical thermodynamics, mass, species and heat transfer, resulting in a system of differential equations which are discretized in space using a three-dimensional cell-centered finite volume scheme, namely a volume element model (VEM). A Michaelis-Menten type expression is proposed for modeling the rate of H-2 production with dependence on O-2 inhibition. Tridimensional simulations are performed in order to determine the mass fractions distributions inside a compact photobioreactor (PBR), under different operating conditions. A relatively coarse mesh was used (6048 volume elements) to obtain converged results for a large compact PBR computational domain (2 m x 5 m x 8 m). The largest computational time required for obtaining results was 560 s, i.e., less than 10 min. The numerical results for microalgal growth are validated by direct comparison to experimental measurements. Hydrogen production simulations are conducted to demonstrate PBR intermittent operation (aerobic and anaerobic stages) feasibility and adequate species evolution trends in an indirect biophotolysis approach. Therefore, after experimental validation for a particular H-2 production system, it is reasonable to state that the model could be used as an efficient tool for PBR systems thermal design, control and optimization for maximum H-2 production.

This technique uses portable, low-cost instrumentation but its applications have been limited to short monolithic columns because of components not resistant to high pressures. Objective To develop a SIC method for determination of DFAA by exploring an instrument modified to handle pressures of 1000psi. Method The method was based on pre-column derivatisation of the amino acids with o-phthalaldehyde and 2-mercaptoethanol in borate buffer (pH 9.4), separation and fluorimetric detection (excitation=340 and emission=450nm). Separation was achieved by stepwise gradient elution using six mobile phases. The first elution step used a mobile phase composed of methanol:tetrahydrofuran:10mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at a volumetric ratio of 8:1:91. Additional elution steps used mobile phases containing methanol and 10mM phosphate buffer at ratios of 17.5:82.5, 25:75, 35:65, 50:50 and 65:35. Results Nineteen chromatographic peaks were observed in a mixture of 20 amino acids. The only complete co-elution was between tryptophan and methionine. Detection limits varied from 0.10 mu m for isoleucine to 1.5 mu m for lysine. Recoveries from spiked extracts were between 84 and 131%. Conclusion Resolutions of the amino acid pairs glutamine and histidine, valine and phenylalanine, and isoleucine and leucine were 1.5, 0.75 and 1.3, respectively. The proposed method found different profiles of DFAA among the three species of algae, suggesting its adequacy for metabolic studies.

It grows photoautotrophically, but the medium complementation with organic carbon may stimulate its growth. S. platensis was grown autotrophically and mixotrofically with 0.25| 0.50| 0.75 and 1.00 g.L-1 of powder molasses (MEP) or liquid molasses (MEL). Cultures with MEL or MEP have grown for more long time (minimum 35 days) and have reached higher biomass concentration and productivity than autotrophic one, that grew during 30 days. Cultures with MEP 0.25 g.L-1 have reached biomass concentration of 2.59 g.L-1 and productivity of 0.066 g.L-1.day(-1). Maximum biomass concentration (2.83 g.L-1) and productivity (0.098 g.L-.day(-1-)) were reached in cultures with MEL 0.50 g.L-1. Autotrophic cultures reached 1.44 g.L-1 and 0.045 g.L-1.day(-1).

Relative growth rates, nitrate reductase and carbonic anhydrase activities were daily determined and correlated to the concentration of nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, inorganic and organic carbon in the media. Nitrate reductase catalyzes the reversible carbon dioxide hydration reaction. The activity profiles of both enzymes during 10 days of cultivation under aeration with air showed an inverse relationship: the maximum in the activity of nitrate reductase coincided with the minimum of carbonic anhydrase activity. An ionizable organic carbon species with pKa in the range of metabolites of the photorespiratory path was found parallel with the increase of carbonic anhydrase activity and the decrease of nitrate reductase activity. The onset of photorespiration is probably one of the factors involved in the simultaneous regulation of these enzymatic processes.

Hydrodynamic characterization, growth kinetics, removal of carbon dioxide and oxygen release rates, carbon and energy balances, and requirements of the surface area were determined. The results showed that the hybrid photobioreactor presented high hydrodynamic performance (mixing time of 98s, circulation time of 39s, Reynolds number of 2500 and empty bed residence time of 60s). The carbon dioxide bioconversion kinetics for Scenedesmus obliquus CPCCO5 showed maximum specific growth rates of 0.96 d(-1), and a maximum cell biomass of 2.8 kg/m(3). In parallel, an average carbon dioxide conversion and oxygen release rates of 45.32 kg(CO2)/m(3)/d and 33.98 kgo2/m(3)/d were obtained, respectively. The carbon balance indicated that a small fraction (1.28%) of the carbon dioxide is fixed into a biomass form. Volatile organic compounds (82.75%) were the main products formed in the photobioreactor. The energy balance provided a net energy ratio of 2.49. Finally, this photobioreactor configuration requires a volumetric surface area in order to 0.22 m(2)/m(3). (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To do so, two HRPs were used: one had CO2 at a concentration of 99.9% (HRP 1), and the other had gas from the combustion of gasoline (HRP 2). Biomass yield, sewage treatment efficiency and the economic viability of using these two sources were assessed. The results showed that the CO2 source did not influence the domestic sewage treatment or the yield and biochemical composition of biomass, since there was no statistical difference (p < 0.05) between the values measured for both ponds. The mean yield values were 6.00 and 6.12 g m(-2) day(-1), respectively for the HRPs 1 and 2. As for the mean concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and the percentages of removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), they were in the average for both HRPs (26.4 mg L-1 and 31.2%). The negative Net Present Values (NPV) showed that in this study the investments for installing external CO2 sources are not economically viable for any of the two studied sources, when the biomass produced in the HRPs is used for the production of biofuels and as source of protein for animal feeding. The initial investments, allied to the prices of the biomass, were the factors that mostly influenced the economic analysis, contributing to the lack of attractiveness in this scale. Despite this, the use of atmospheric emissions along with domestic sewage as a cultivation medium means the biomass produced in this study has less environmental impact when compared to similar biomasses.

Its thermal behavior under a heating rate of 10 A degrees C min(-1) and inert atmosphere shows that decomposition occurs in two stages. Stage I (125-309 A degrees C) involves the pyrolysis of carbohydrates and protein and stage II (309-501 A degrees C) the pyrolysis of lipids. The Starink isoconversional method showed a better application for simulation curves, compared with methods of FWO and KAS. The average values of activated energy were 107.1 and 132.6 kJ mol(-1) for stages I and II, respectively, which indicates that pyrolysis occurs more easily in stage I than in stage II. The conversion rate curves show that the calculated kinetic parameters are satisfactory for the evaluation of the thermochemical systems.;[Francisco Alves, Jose Luiz| Gomes Da Silva, Jean Constantino| Costa, Rosangela Lucio| Dos Santos Junior, Seldis Fernando| da Silva Filho, Valdemar Francisco| Peralta Muniz Moreira, Regina De Fatima| Jose, Humberto Jorge] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Chem Engn, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil;Da Silva, JCG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Chem Engn, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;zeluiz_alves@hotmail.com| jean.constantino@cear.ufpb.br| rosangela.lucio@gmail.com| seldisjr@hotmail.com| valdemarfilho21@hotmail.com| regina@enq.ufsc.br| humberto@enq.ufsc.br;DA SILVA, VALDEMAR/AAL-4626-2020| de Fatima Peralta Muniz Moreira, Regina/ABG-5854-2020| Jose, Humberto Jorge/J-9724-2012| da Silva, Jean/F-8684-2017| Alves, Jose Luiz Francisco/G-6910-2019| Galdino, Wendell/AAG-3599-2020| da Silva, Jean Constantino Gomes/P-5035-2019;DA SILVA, VALDEMAR/0000-0003-0269-8345| Jose, Humberto Jorge/0000-0002-9219-0942| da Silva, Jean/0000-0003-2600-7123| Alves, Jose Luiz Francisco/0000-0003-3098-3530| Galdino, Wendell/0000-0002-5145-4868| da Silva, Jean Constantino Gomes/0000-0003-2600-7123;National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)CAPES;The authors are grateful for the financial support to this research from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES).;;41;14;14;2;10;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1388-6150;1588-2926;;J THERM ANAL CALORIM;J.

Among achieved results, the best solvent extractor was a hexane: ethanol mixture in a 1:1 (v/v) proportion. In order to obtain maximum yield, the pattern stablished includes six extractions performed for 40 minutes. Stability tests presented that xanthophylls and carotenes pigments were more stable in methanol and that xanthophylls and carotenes pigments were less negatively affected than chlorophylls in the methanolic extract.

The effect of variation in the composition of culturing medium on the neutral and polar lipids productivity, and fatty acid profile of solvent extracts of microalgae biomass was studied. Determination of unsaturated fatty acid composition (C18: N = 1-3,.3 C20: 5,.3 C22: 6), polyunsaturated fatty esters (PUFEs), saturated fatty acids (SFAs), unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), free fatty acids (FFAs), and iodine value were achieved from a single H-1 NMR spectral analysis. The results were validated by C-13 NMR and GC-MS analyses. It was demonstrated that newly developed methods based on 1H and 13C NMR techniques are direct, rapid, and convenient for monitoring the microalgae cultivation process for enhancement of lipid productivity and their quality aspects in the solvent extracts of microalgal biomasses without any sample treatment and prior separation compared to other methods. The fatty acid composition of algae extracts was found to be similar to vegetable and fish oils, mostly rich in C16: 0, C18: N (N = 0 to 3), and n-3 omega polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The lipid content, particularly neutral lipids, as well as most of the quality parameters were found to be medium specific by both the strains. The newly developed methods based on NMR and ultrasonic procedure developed for efficient extraction of neutral lipids are cost economic and can be an effective aid for rapid screening of algae strains for modulation of lipid productivity with desired biodiesel quality and value-added products including fatty acid profile.;[Sarpal, Amarjit S.| Martins Silva, Paulo Roque| da Costa Monteiro, Thays Vieira| da Silva, Julia Itacolomy| da Cunha, Valnei Smarcaro| Daroda, Romeu Jose] Natl Inst Metrol Standardizat & Ind Qual INMETRO, Ave Nossa Senhora Gracas 50, Duque De Caxias, RJ, Brazil| [Teixeira, Claudia M.

The objective function was the flocculation efficiency (eta(f)), which was evaluated by central composite design (CCD) experiments which varied the Tanfloc concentration (TC) and pH. Subsequently, the biomass recoveries of highly efficient flocculants recommended by the literature and the CCD conditions of Tanfloc were compared. The maximum flocculation efficiency (96.7 +/- 1.0 %) was obtained for the following optimal conditions: 210 mg/L Tanfloc concentration, pH 7.8. After jar test experiments, the scale-up of the process was performed by using the best obtained results and applying Tanfloc in a 1 m(3) flocculator where the complementary analyses demonstrated efficient nitrogen, carbon, and biomass removal. The flocculation efficiency obtained with Tanfloc was equivalent to that of most conventional flocculants currently used. However, Tanfloc presented the following economic advantages with respect to other flocculants: i) its nontoxic nature allows for low-cost disposal| and ii) its low market price makes it a promising alternative for harvesting microalgae biomass.;[de Oliveira, Thamayne V.| Vieira, Rafael B.] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Engn Quim, Programa Pos Grad Engn Quim, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [Selesu, Nelson F.

Due to high photosynthetic efficiency, microalgae are considered as a potential feedstock for next-generations biofuel conversion processes. This paper addresses the thermochemical conversion of highly diluted microalgae feedstock into synthetic natural gas (SNG) through supercritical hydrothermal gasification. The complete conversion chain is modeled including the cultivation phase, settling ponds, centrifuges, catalytic hydrothermal gasification with salt separation unit and SNG purification system. Thermodynamic, economic and environmental models are considered for each process step, in order to solve a Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming (MINLP) optimization problem. The problem is solved by applying a two steps decomposition approach, using Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). It is finally demonstrated that coupling microalgae cultivation systems with hydrothermal gasification (HTG) and waste energy recovery utilities leads to high energy/exergy efficiencies, emissions reduction and globally better sustainable processes.

The chemical shift assignments observed in the H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra corresponding to unsaturated (C18:N, N = 1-3, C20:3, C20:5, C22:6, epoxy) and saturated (C14-C18) fatty acid ester components in a complex matrix involving overlapped resonances have been unambiguously confirmed by the application of 2D NMR spectroscopy (total correlation spectroscopy and heteronuclear single quantum coherence-total correlation spectroscopy). The study of the effect of a polar lipid matrix on the determination of neutral lipids by an internal reference blending process by a systematic designed experimental protocol has provided absolute quantification. The fatty acid composition of algal extracts was found to be similar to that of vegetable oils containing saturated (C16-C18:0) and unsaturated (C18:N, N = 1-3, C20:N, N = 3-4, C22:6) fatty acids as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. The NMR methods developed offer great potential for rapid screening of algal strains for generation of algal biomass with the desired lipid content, quality, and potential for biodiesel and value-added polyunsaturated fatty acids in view of the cost economics of the overall cost of generation of the biomass.;[Sarpal, Amarijt S.| Silva, Paulo R.

The microalga Spirulina sp. LEB 18 synthesizes bioproducts, such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), which is biodegradable and has similar mechanical and thermal properties to polymers of petrochemical origin. Moreover, phenolic compounds of microalgae have antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant activities, which is a differential for the development of packaging. The objective of the study was to develop a nanomaterial with antibacterial action from bioproducts of microalgal origin. PHB nanofibers containing phenolic compounds presented average diameter of 810 +/- 85 nm exhibited hydrophobicity, which gave protection to the food relative to the moisture outside the package. These nanofibers showed inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 with a zone of 7.5 +/- 0.4 mm. Thermal and mechanical properties have confirmed the potential applicability of this material as food packaging. This new nanomaterial combines a packaging function to protect products and to be biodegradable with the antibacterial activity that prevents the proliferation of microorganisms and ensures the quality and preservation of food.

Biomass was grown suspended in the growth media of high-rate ponds (HRPs) and attached in biofilm reactors (BRs). These hybrid systems were operated with and without the addition of CO2(HS2 and HS1, respectively) in the HRP growth media. The performances of these systems were compared with that of a conventional HRP with CO2 supplementation. Regarding sewage treatment with microalgae and bacteria consortia, the three systems showed no significant differences in the removal of organisms associated with faecal contamination, organic matter and most nutrients. However, nitrate levels were increased in the hybrid systems due to the presence of BRs. There were no differences in algal biomass production among the three systems, which remained in the 0.6-0.7 g m(-2) range. HS1 showed the highest total biomass production of 101.31 g m(-2) at a production rate of 6.79 g m(-2) day(-1). The BR of HS1 was able to supply the necessary CO2 and therefore no additional gas supplementation was required. This result indicates that a conventional HRP with CO2 supplementation can be replaced by a hybrid system with biofilm reactor, with additional advantages of resources saving, operational simplicity and easier harvesting.

Five strains of microalgae were isolated from municipal wastewater and grown in autoclaved and non-autoclaved effluent at 30 A degrees C and 150 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) to study biomass production, nutrient removal, and the biochemical composition of the biomass. All strains reached high biomass productivity (35.6 to 54.2 mg dry weight L-1 day(-1)) within 4 days of batch culturing. In this period, ammonium-N and phosphate were reduced by more than 60 and 90 %, respectively. The high growth rate (0.57 to 1.06 day(-1)) ensured a rapid removal of nutrients and thereby a short retention time. By the fourth day of cultivation, the algal biomass contained 32 % protein, but only 11 % lipids and 18 % carbohydrates. It was found that the biomass was a suitable raw material for biogas production by anaerobic digestion. Biodigestion of obtained biomass was simulated by employing the Aspen HYSYS modeling software, resulting in methane yields comparable to those found in the literature. The elemental analysis of the algal biomass showed very low concentrations of pollutants, demonstrating the potential of use of the digestate from biodigestion as a bio-fertilizer.;[Diniz, Graciela S.| Chaloub, Ricardo M.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Biotecnol Vegetal, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil| [Silva, Anita F.| Chaloub, Ricardo M.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Quim, Dept Bioquim, Ctr Tecnol, Ave Athos Silveira Ramos 149,Bl A,Sala 532, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil| [Araujo, Ofelia Q.

In Exp. 1, the chemical composition and in vitro protein degradability of 9 algae species and 4 protein supplements were determined. In Exp. 2, rumen function and microbial protein (MCP) production were determined in Bos indicus steers fed speargrass hay alone or supplemented with Spirulina platensis, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Dunaliella salina, or cottonseed meal (CSM). In Exp. 3, DMI and ADG were determined in B. indicus steers fed speargrass hay alone or supplemented with increasing amounts of NPN (urea combined with ammonia sulfate), CSM, or S. platensis. In Exp. 1, the CP content of S. platensis and C. pyrenoidosa (675 and 580 g/kg DM) was highest among the algae species and higher than the other protein supplements evaluated, and Schizochytrium sp. had the highest crude lipid (CL) content (198 g/kg DM). In Exp. 2, S. platensis supplementation increased speargrass hay intake, the efficiency of MCP production, the fractional outflow rate of digesta from the rumen, the concentration of NH3N, and the molar proportion of branched-chain fatty acids in the rumen fluid of steers above all other treatments. Dunaliella salina acceptance by steers was low and this resulted in no significant difference to unsupplemented steers for all parameters measured for this algae supplement. In Exp. 3, ADG linearly increased with increasing supplementary N intake from both S. platensis and NPN, with no difference between the 2 supplements. In contrast, ADG quadratically increased with increasing supplementary N intake from CSM. It was concluded that S. platensis and C. pyrenoidosa may potentially be used as protein sources for cattle grazing low-CP pastures.;[Costa, D. F.

The semi-enclosed system was composed of 1.2 m(3) circular tanks installed inside of a greenhouse. Water temperature was 4 degrees C higher in the indoor treatment than in the outdoor, mainly in winter although no difference was observed in warmer seasons. Moreover, variation in salinity was observed in the outdoor treatment due to rainfall (winter) and evaporation (spring), whereas indoor treatment experienced an increase (up to 100 PSU) due to evaporation only in warmer seasons. Light transmission was approximately 20% lower in the indoor treatment although cell densities and biomass yields were higher indoor during winter. As the temperature increased (spring) no differences were observed among treatments. In summary, partial control of temperature and salinity in the semi-enclosed system, especially during the colder and rainy season, allowed higher microalgae biomass production. Further experiments must be conducted with CO2 addition, larger pH range and salinity control. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This feature can lead to economic benefits in the production process of biodiesel by way of the clean development mechanism, for which carbon credits for environmental benefits may be granted and which will contribute towards reducing costs in the production process. This study seeks to quantify the contribution of carbon credits in the operating costs of a route for biodiesel production from microalgae, as proposed by Davis et al. [Techno-economic analysis of autotrophic microalgae for fuel production. Appl Energy. 2011|88:3524-3531]. The results showed a reduction in annual operating costs by around 5%. This figure may be conservative, since the production process considered can be further improved to reduce operating costs and thus increase the contribution margin of carbon credits, which will reduce costs. On the other hand, the price of carbon may also rise in the future, thereby increasing its contribution towards a reduction in operating costs.;[Soares, Fabio Rubens| Martins, Gilberto] Univ Fed ABC, Ctr Engn Modelagem & Ciencias Sociais Aplicadas, BR-09210170 Santo Andre, SP, Brazil| [Soares, Fabio Rubens| Miyamaru Seo, Emilia Satoshi] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Pesquisas Energet & Nucl, Ctr Ciencias & Tecnol Mat, Sao Paulo, Brazil| [Soares, Fabio Rubens| Miyamaru Seo, Emilia Satoshi] Ctr Univ Senac, Grp Pesquisa Sustentabilidade, Sao Paulo, Brazil;Soares, FR (corresponding author), Univ Fed ABC, Ctr Engn Modelagem & Ciencias Sociais Aplicadas, Rua Santa Adelia,166 Bairro Bangu, BR-09210170 Santo Andre, SP, Brazil.;fabio.rsoares@sp.senac.br;Martins, Gilberto/D-5229-2012;Martins, Gilberto/0000-0003-0565-2289| Satoshi Miyamaru Seo, Emilia/0000-0002-8217-608X;;;;20;13;13;1;31;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0959-3330;;;ENVIRON TECHNOL;Environ.

In addition, there are three culture collections of macroalgae in the country. Most of these collections hold small numbers of strains, and only five of them have more than 150 strains. An increasing interest in microalgal cultures has been experienced in Brazil, especially due to the development of aquaculture, use of algae in ecotoxicity tests, and monitoring of harmful algal blooms. In addition, the provision of financial support by governmental agencies has stimulated the growth of aquatic sciences, including uses and applications of cultivation of microalgae. The continental dimension and variety of environments in Brazil mean that there is an enormous microalgal biodiversity to be assessed, especially in freshwater habitats. Brazilian culture collections are concentrated in the South and Southeast regions of the country and mainly hold local strains. Efforts must be done to create culture collections in other regions and a network of researchers to isolate and cultivate strains from different parts of the country. The ongoing expansion of the Elizabeth Aidar Microalgal Culture Collection, Federal Fluminense University, represents the start of the organization of a national reference center for cultivation of marine microalgae.;Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Biol Marinha, BR-24001970 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil| Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Bot, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil;Lourenco, SO (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Biol Marinha, Caixa Postal 100644, BR-24001970 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.;solourenco@yahoo.com;Vieira, Armando AH/I-3894-2013;;;;;125;13;14;1;4;GEBRUDER BORNTRAEGER;STUTTGART;JOHANNESSTR 3A, D-70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY;0029-5035;2363-7188;;NOVA HEDWIGIA;Nova Hedwigia;AUG;2004;79;1-2;;;;;149;173;;10.1127/0029-5035/2004/0079-0149;;;25;Plant Sciences;Plant Sciences;854OD;WOS:000223912300014;;;;;2021-01-01

The mechanism involved in Cd accumulation on Tetraselmis chuii was restricted to surface phenomena, while in Spirulina maxima, Cd was accumulated on different layers of the cyanobacterium surface. In order to select a suitable immobilization support for the cells, several seaweeds were tested. Two types of seaweed were selected for experiments, using a small continuous pilot unit: Sargassum sp., a strong Cd adsorber, and Ulva sp., a Poor one. The column reactors of the continuous system were filled with the algal supports and covered with dense microbial biofilms of Tetraselmis chuii or Spirulina maxima.

Cultures exposed to the MF for 1 h d(-1) (in both intensities) had greater biomass concentrations (1.42 g L-1) and 34% more productivity in the same time as the control assay. The biofixation rate increased by 50% with 60 mT for 1 h d(-1), and the protein content was enhanced by 30 mT (56.21% w w(-1)). This study was the first to consider the MF effect on CO2 biofixation.

However, production at a commercial scale is still costly in part due to a lack of knowledge of their biology which in turn limits our ability to increase their overall growth rate or alter their metabolism and composition through changes in culture conditions or genetic engineering. We therefore isolated ten strains of freshwater microalgae (Chlorophyta) and characterized them at the morphological, molecular and biochemical level under autotrophic conditions. Two Scenedesmus strains (BR003 and BR024) differed from others strains in respect to their fatty acid profile, with high levels of C16 and C18:1 and low levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Interestingly, Chlamydomonas sp. BR020 and Chlorella vulgaris BR017 showed high levels of a-linolenic acid (C18:3), while BR017 also exhibited higher protein levels (14% of total dry weight), suggesting that these may be interesting strains to be used within the biorefinery concept. Furthermore, Monoraphidium sp. BR023 showed higher lipid content (29% of total dry weight), and transesterifiable fatty acid production (43.2 mu g mg(-1) dry weight) and lower starch levels (164 mu mol mg(-1) dry weight) while Chlamydomonas sp. BR020 exhibited the opposite trend. The results suggest that Scenedesmus bajacalifornicus BR024, Selenastrum capricornutum BR009 and Scenedesmus obliquus BR003 represent potential strains for biomass and biodiesel production, presenting 1.81, 1.73 and 2.14 mg mL(-1) dry weight of biomass, respectively, and 21.6, 16.4 and 17% of total dry weight of lipid, respectively. Additionally, the two Scenedesmus species showed the highest lipid productivity (23 mg L-1 d(-1) and 24 mg L-1 d(-1)). Overall we were able to access a new source of microalgal biodiversity and perform a robust characterization of native tropical microalgae strains leading to the identification of strains with high potential for biotechnological applications.;[Rocha, Renan Paulo| Machado, Mariana| Marcal Vieira Vaz, Marcelo Gomes| Araujo, Wagner L.| Nunes-Nesi, Adriano] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Vegetal, Max Planck Partner Grp, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil| [Machado, Mariana] Univ Fed Goias Reg Jatai, Inst Biociencias, BR-75801615 Goiania, Go, Brazil| [Vinson, Christina C.| Williams, Thomas C.

Among the existing techniques available for harvesting and dewatering microalgal biomass, recovery from aqueous medium by coagulation-flocculation has been the most economically viable process, althoughit is highly dependent on pH. This study aims to assess alternative coagulants compared to the standard coagulant aluminum sulfate for microalgal biomass recovery from anaerobic effluent of domestic sewage treatment. The effluent quality was also analyzed after biomass recovery. Coagulants represented by modified tannin, cationic starch and aluminum sulfate recovered more than 90% of algae biomass, at concentrations greater than 80 mg/L, in the pH range 7-10. Cationic starch promoted higher microalgal biomass recovery with a wider pH range. Powdered seeds of Moringa oleifera and Hibiscus esculentus(okra) gum promoted biomass removal of 50%, only in the acidic range of pH. After sedimentation of the microalgal biomass, the effluents showed a removal of >80% for phosphorus and nitrogen values and >50% for BOD and COD when using aluminum sulfate, cationic starch and modified tannin as coagulants. Natural organic coagulants in a wide pH range can replace aluminum sulfate, a reference coagulant in microalgal biomass recovery, without decreasing microalgal biomass harvesting efficiency and the quality of the final effluent.;[Cassini, Servio Tulio| Francisco, Sara Aparecida| Pereira Antunes, Paulo Wagner| Oss, Rodrigo Nunes| Keller, Regina] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Environm Engn, Vitoria, ES, Brazil;Cassini, ST (corresponding author), Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Environm Engn, Vitoria, ES, Brazil.;scassini@terra.com.br;CASSINI, SERVIO TULIO ALVES/O-7320-2019;CASSINI, SERVIO TULIO ALVES/0000-0001-5200-3666| Keller, Regina/0000-0002-9163-0715;FINEP/UFES| CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq);This work was completed under the Biogas Project.

The cultures were maintained under controlled conditions and their growth responses, productivities, biochemical compositions, and the ester profiles of their biomasses were compared to the results obtained in the synthetic media. The MDS and HB media demonstrated promising results for cultivation, especially of Chlorella sp., Chlamydomonas sp., and Lagerheimia longiseta, which demonstrated productivities superior to those seen when grown on the control media. The highest lipid levels were obtained with the HB medium.

The study focused on optimization of the cultivation parameters (temperature and C/N ratio), on the evaluation of different operational modes of bioreactor (batch, fed-batch and continuous) and on the analysis of the biofuel quality. The results indicate that temperatures of 30 C-circle and C/N ratio of 68 improved the performance of system. Additionally, the continuous cultivation optimizes the rate of formation of product, reaching biomass productivities of 320.1 mg/L h in parallel to oil productivities of 43.8 mg/L h. Finally, the fuel properties of the biodiesel indicated an ester content of 99.98%, a cetane number of 57.28, an iodine value of 45.22 gl(2) 100 g (-1), a degree of unsaturation of 49.27%, and a cold filter plugging point of 61.43 C-circle. The technological route developed indicates potential to sustainable production of bulk oil and biodiesel, through the minimization of water and chemicals demand needed to support such bioprocess.

Extractions were performed with the microalgae Chlorella pyrenoidosa at 65.71% moisture. The Bligh and Dyer methodology, using the solvents 2-MeTHF:isoamyl alcohol (2:1 v/v) and CPME:methanol (1:1.7 v/ v), extracted 95.73 +/- 0.52 and 89.35 +/- 7.98 mg lipids/g biomass, respectively. Regarding fatty acids yield, CPME showed higher selectivity than 2-MeTHF. A brief cost-effectiveness and energy analysis of the extraction process was performed. Based on the calculations, this study concluded that the energy required for the evaporation of the solvent and mixture of solvents after the extraction process has no significant economic impact| the largest expense is associated with solvent consumption. To extract 1 kg of fatty acids, the Hara and Radin method using hexane:isopropanol (3:2 v/v) proved to be the most costeffective. Results show that these solvents prices' are still not competitive when compared to fossil-based solvents. The price reduction of 2-MeTHE would make it more attractive than CPME, as it requires a lower amount of biomass. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Lipids from the microalgae Chlorella pyrenoidosa were extracted through the tertiary systems 2-methyltetrahydrofuran:isoamylalcohol:water (1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 v/v) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran:ethanol:water (3:1 v/v). For comparative effect, extractions with chloroform:methanol:water (3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 v/v), with binary systems 2-methyltetrahydrofuran:water, isoamyl alcohol:water, chloroform:water, n-hexane:water, and monophasic systems 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF), isoamyl alcohol, chloroform and n-hexane were used. The Bligh and Dyer method using green solvents was highly efficient, although some undesirable components were extracted, especially when larger volumes of isoamyl alcohol were used. System 2-MeTHF:ethanol:water formed only a biphasic system when it was used in a 3:1 (v/v) proportion, obtaining 64% of fatty acids. The chloroform:methanol (1:2 v/v) system extracted 122.2 +/- 1.9 mg g(-1), in which 92.4% consisted of fatty acids. In systems using green solvents, the extractions with the system 2-MeTHF:isoamyl alcohol (2:1 v/v) achieved a 78% selectivity (99.6 +/- 7.6 mg g(-1) of fatty acids) and an 88.2% efficiency when compared with the reference system chloroform:methanol 1:2 (v/v).The fatty acids profile showed that extractions with 2-MeTHF:isoamyl alcohol had higher percentages of fatty acids with low degree of unsaturation, which is ideal for the production of better quality biodiesel. The results obtained suggest that 2-MeTHF:isoamyl alcohol (2:1 v/v) can replace the chloroform:methanol system currently used. M an industrial level, this system still requires some technical improvements related to the energy expenditure for solvent evaporation, and at an economic level, the high price of the 2-MeTHF makes the process impracticable compared with hexane.;[de Jesus, Sergio S.| Ferreira, Gabriela F.| Fregolente, Leonardo, V| Maciel Filho, Rubens] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Chem Engn, Lab Optimizat Design & Adv Control, PO 6066, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil;de Jesus, SS (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Chem Engn, Lab Optimizat Design & Adv Control, PO 6066, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil.;ssjesus@gmail.com;;Fregolente, Leonardo/0000-0002-3271-4732| Filipini Ferreira, Gabriela/0000-0002-2645-2027;State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2010/03764-3, 2015/19609-0]| National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [166844/2017-9];This study was supported by the State of Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, grant process no. 2010/03764-3 and 2015/19609-0), Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (PNPD-CAPES), National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, grant process no. 166844/2017-9), and Espaco da Escrita (Coordenadoria Geral UNICAMP) for the language services provided.;;35;11;11;2;12;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2211-9264;;;ALGAL RES;Algal Res.;NOV;2018;35;;;;;;292;300;;10.1016/j.algal.2018.09.001;;;9;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;GW7YA;WOS:000447187700030;;;;;2021-01-01

Studies on the environmental impacts of this process are fundamental to make these systems feasible. In these studies, a life cycle assessment of the production of microalgae biomass is important. We performed this study considering the production in wastewater or NPK medium and different methods of biomass separation. The LCA model was developed for the production of 9 and 12 kg of Desmodesmus subspicatus microalgae biomass in 10 days, which represents the production in 8000 L of wastewater and NPK solution, respectively. The total volume corresponded to 4 tanks of 2000 L each. The growth system used was an open raceway pond with culture movement caused by an air-lift system or by paddle wheels. Flocculation with NaOH and electroflotation with Al and Fe were chosen as the methods of biomass separation. These methods were chosen because they facilitate the separation using filtration or centrifugation. The final step was drying, which can be conducted with the biomass after filtration (80% water) or centrifugation (40% water). Several scenarios were examined to identify a more environmentally friendly method for microalgae biomass production. There were no differences using air lift or paddle wheels, however it was identified impacts in all stages. Also, there were fewer impacts using wastewater than using NPK. Regarding the separation of the biomass, electroflotation caused fewer impacts when compared to flocculation with NaOH. Overall, the scenario with fewest impacts was the one configured using wastewater for microalgae cultivation, followed by centrifugation and drying.;[de Souza Schneider, Rosana de Cassia| Lima, Marcelo de Moura| Hoeltz, Michele| de Azevedo, Amaro] Santa Cruz do Sul Univ, Environm Technol Postgraduat Program, BR-96815900 Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil| [de Souza Schneider, Rosana de Cassia| John, Danielle Kochenborger] Santa Cruz do Sul Univ, Dept Chem & Phys, BR-96815900 Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil| [Hoeltz, Michele] Santa Cruz do Sul Univ, Dept Biol & Pharm, BR-96815900 Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil| [Neves, Fabio de Farias] Santa Catarina State Univ, Dept Fisheries Engn, BR-88790000 Laguna, SC, Brazil;Schneider, RDD (corresponding author), Santa Cruz do Sul Univ, Environm Technol Postgraduat Program, BR-96815900 Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil.;rosana@unisc.br;John, Danielle/AAT-7974-2020| John, Danielle Kochenborger/AAG-7376-2020| Neves, Fabio/M-1267-2019| Schneider, Rosana/A-1085-2013;John, Danielle Kochenborger/0000-0002-6442-4764| Neves, Fabio/0000-0003-4717-4684| Schneider, Rosana/0000-0003-1400-8401;;;;69;11;11;2;32;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2211-9264;;;ALGAL RES;Algal Res.;JUN;2018;32;;;;;;280;292;;10.1016/j.algal.2018.04.012;;;13;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;GG4FE;WOS:000432649800030;;;;;2021-01-01

Species-specific in vitro pH-Stat protein hydrolysis was used to predict the DP contents of three algal meals produced from a common lot of the marine eustigmatophyte microalga, Nannochloropsis granulata, for juvenile Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Protein degree of hydrolysis (DH) and predicted protein apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) for Pacific white shrimp were statistically similar for all meals with average DH of 2.09% (P = 0.052) and predicted ADC of 74.6% (P = 0.053). Alternatively, meals processed by supercritical fluid extraction at 70 and 90 degrees C showed significantly (P < 0.001) higher DH and predicted ADC than the untreated base material for rainbow trout with average DH of 4.79% and predicted ADC of 87.0%, compared to 2.53% and 79.1%, respectively. Predicted protein ADC for all N. granulata meals was moderate for Pacific white shrimp (69-78%) and high for rainbow trout (79-88%) and therefore indicates their potential for use in fish and shrimp diets. Based on our results, we suggest DP values (dry matter basis) for similar N. granulata meals of 26% for Pacific white shrimp and 29% for rainbow trout.

Cultures of C. minor var. minor were grown using WC (Wright's cryptophyte) and BBM (Bold's Basal medium) media. BBM medium produced more biomass (984.3 mg L-1) compared to the WC medium (525.7 mg L-1). Despite this result, WC medium produced a higher methyl ester yield for biodiesel production than the BBM medium (170.0 and 90.2 mg g(-1) of biomass, respectively). The average percentage of fatty acids obtained using the WC medium (17.0 %) was similar to soybean (18.0 %) and with similar biomass fatty acid profile.

More recently, these microorganisms have been considered as an important feedstock for biodiesel production. However, the concentration of produced biomass represents a large parcel of production costs. In this study, we have evaluated the influence of natural pH variation of culture medium, caused by photosynthetic activity, on the flocculation of the marine microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata. Experiments were conducted with the same culture with different pH values (8.5 and 9.6), obtained after exposing the cells to different light conditions. For each pH value, different treatments were composed by adding 0, 5, 10, and 30 mM of NaOH and the flocculant Flopam (R) (FO4800 SH) at concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, and 5 ppm. Higher flocculation efficiencies were obtained for the culture with pH 9.6 in comparison to 8.5 for the same NaOH and Flopam concentrations. Lower concentrations of base and flocculant were needed for flocculating the culture in higher pH, representing an economy of 20 % in the costs of crop harvesting.;[Sales, Rafael| Abreu, Paulo Cesar] Fed Univ Rio Grande FURG, Inst Oceanog, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil| [Sales, Rafael] Fed Univ Pernambuco UFPE, Dept Oceanog, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, Brazil;Sales, R (corresponding author), Fed Univ Pernambuco UFPE, Dept Oceanog, Av Arquitetura,S-N Cidade Univ, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, Brazil.;rafael_ojs@hotmail.com| docpca@furg.br;Abreu, Paulo Cesar/A-5145-2013| Sales, Rafael/X-1624-2019;Abreu, Paulo Cesar/0000-0002-7657-1112| Sales, Rafael/0000-0002-2235-8076;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [574737/2008-1];This study was financially supported by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico CNPq (Proc no 574737/2008-1).

Chemical analyses of aromatics, non-aromatics hydrocarbons and methanol were carried out in the WSF, the former showing positive correlation with increasing diesel concentrations (B100 < B5 < B3 < B2 < D). Biodiesel interacted with the aqueous matrix, generating methanol, which showed lower toxicity than the diesel contaminants in blends. The WSF caused 50% culture growth inhibition (IC50-96 h) at concentrations varying from 2.3 to 85.6%, depending on the tested fuels and species. However, the same species sensitivity trend (S. costatum > N. oculata > T.chuii > P. subcapitata) was observed for all the tested fuels.;[Pereira, Solange A.| Araujo, Vinicius Queiroz| Nascimento, Iracema Andrade] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, LABIOMAR, BR-40170010 Salvador, BA, Brazil| [Reboucas, Marcio V.| Vieira, Fernanda Seabra V.| de Almeida, Marcos Vinicio A.] BRASKEM SA, Unidade Insumos Basicos Bahia, Camacari, Bahia, Brazil| [Chinalia, Fabio A.] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England;Nascimento, IA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, LABIOMAR, Campus Ondina,Av Ocean 2353-403 Ondina, BR-40170010 Salvador, BA, Brazil.;toiracema@oi.com.br;Reboucas, Marcio/H-3079-2016| chinalia, fabio alexadre/M-8227-2013| Nascimento, Iracema A/L-5069-2015;Reboucas, Marcio/0000-0002-8094-9587| chinalia, fabio alexadre/0000-0001-9775-6442| ;National Council for the Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ) /Science and Technology Ministry, BrazilNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [574712/2008-9, 551134/2010-0];This work benefited from the support (Processes 574712/2008-9 and 551134/2010-0) from the National Council for the Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ) /Science and Technology Ministry, Brazil.

Both methods were applied to simulated and experimental potentiometric titration data and were able to detect small variations of inorganic carbon species during 10 days of batch cultivation. The MGF were able to determine the concentration of an additional titratable species with pK(b) values between 9.5 and 9.9 that appears in the medium after the 4th day of cultivation. This species may be assigned to carboxylate groups of organic carbon compounds excreted by the algae. Treatment of the titration data with the derivative method did not permit the quantitative determination of the concentration of the additional titratable species, but no interference was observed in the results obtained for the inorganic carbon species.

Thus, this study aims to select a microalgae species that is both tolerant and capable of the bioremoval of heavy metals from metal mine tailings water as well as the potential biorefinery of this microalgae biomass. Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus spinosus were tested for tolerance to metal mine tailings water (MTW) in northern Chile and synthetic treatments of Cu and Mo (0.1 and 0.5 mg/L). Additionally, the biomass generated was characterized to evaluate its potential applications. The main results showed greater tolerance of C. vulgaris cultured in MTW treatment. In fact, high removal efficiency of Cu and Mo was detected for this microalgae in MTW: 64.7% and 99.9%, respectively. Similarly, Cu (55%) and Mo (80.3%) removal was observed at 0.5 mg/L synthetic concentration treatments after 72 h. However, cell wall fluorescence and chlorophyll parameters were mainly affected by 0.5 mg/L Cu synthetic concentration, where the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was 878, compared with the other treatments (>= 1800). Morphological cell changes in the MTW treatment were observed using SEM images. The presence of Mo on the microalgae surface was detected by 0.47% and 0.82% in both Mo synthetic treatments exposed. Additionally, the characterization of microalgae biomass exposed to MTW showed a higher protein content and a minor difference of lipid content compared with the control treatment, which could be used in biorefinery processes. This study reveals the capability of C. vulgaris to remove heavy metals from this mine tailings water and the effect that occurs in microalgae cells.;[Urrutia, Cynthia] Univ Arturo Prat, Fac Ingn & Arquitectura, Avda Arturo Prat 2120, Iquique 1110939, Chile| [Urrutia, Cynthia] Univ Los Lagos, Dept Recursos Nat & Medio Ambiente, Chinquihue Km 6, Puerto Montt 5480000, Chile| [Yanez-Mansilla, Erwin] Univ La Frontera, Sci & Technol Bioresource Nucleus BIOREN, Av Francisco Salazar 01145, Temuco 4811230, Chile| [Jeison, David] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ingn Bioquim, Av Brasil 2085, Valparaiso 2362803, Chile;Urrutia, C (corresponding author), Univ Arturo Prat, Fac Ingn & Arquitectura, Avda Arturo Prat 2120, Iquique 1110939, Chile.| Urrutia, C (corresponding author), Univ Los Lagos, Dept Recursos Nat & Medio Ambiente, Chinquihue Km 6, Puerto Montt 5480000, Chile.;cynthia.urrutia@ulagos.cl;Jeison, David/M-5313-2017;Jeison, David/0000-0002-2234-8257;FONDECYT post-doctoral projectComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3160344]| Fondap-CRHIAM Centre [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130015];This work was supported by FONDECYT post-doctoral project 3160344.

The carotenoid and fatty acid content were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry detection method with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mode (HPLC/APCI-MS/MS) and by high resolution gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). For the carotenoid analysis, the developed method presented a rapid response, a good chromatographic separation, higher sensitivity and can provides more compounds information due the mass spectrum. Among the microalgae evaluated, Desmodesmus protuberans (10.3 mg g(-1)), Desmodesmus denticulatus var. linearis (8.43 mg g(-1)) and Chlamydomonas planctogloea (7.4 mg g(-1)) are good lutein sources. Coelastrum sphaericum (15.29 mg g(-1)) and Parachlorella kessleri (22.96 mg g(-1)) showed high astaxanthin content| the others microalgae species presents low carotenoid content. In addition, Chlorella zofingiensis provides high quantities of gamma-linolenic acid (4.3%). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels were lower than 1.1 %. Regarding for biodiesel production, the promising strains are Coelastrum sphaericum and Parachlorella kessleri.;[Soares, Aline Terra| da Costa, Dayane Cristina| Antoniosi Filho, Nelson Roberto] Univ Fed Goias, Inst Quim, Lab Metodos Extracao & Separacao LAMES, Campus II Samambaia, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil| [Henriques Vieira, Armando Augusto] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Bot, Lab Ficol, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil;Soares, AT (corresponding author), Univ Fed Goias, Inst Quim, Lab Metodos Extracao & Separacao LAMES, Campus II Samambaia, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil.;alinets30@gmail.com;Vieira, Armando AH/I-3894-2013| Filho, Nelson Roberto Antoniosi/R-8297-2019| , Aline/C-2774-2017;Filho, Nelson Roberto Antoniosi/0000-0002-3067-0385| costa, dayane cristina/0000-0002-8821-6273| , Aline/0000-0001-7627-8891;Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) (FINEP) [01.10.0457.00]| CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [407556/2013-3, 312019/2013-0]| CAPESCAPES;This work was supported by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) (FINEP (Agreement No. 01.10.0457.00) and CNPq (Case No. 407556/2013-3).

Two novel conceptual plants are investigated, which are both comprised of the same operation units (gasification, water-gas shift, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, upgrading, separation, Rankine cycle and gas turbines) and mainly differ in the location of the water-gas-shift unit. Both plants are found to present a carbon efficiency greater than conventional biomass-to-liquid processes. The most profitable plants in terms of the saleable products yields ca. 0.23 m(3) (1.4 bbl) of liquid transportation fuels (gasoline, kerosene and diesel), ca. 16 kg of hydrogen (716.8 scm), and ca. 1.55 x 10(9)J (430 kW. h) of electricity per 1000 kg of dried microalgae. The corresponding displaced fossil fuels could offset the carbon emissions by 0.56 kg of carbon dioxide for every kg of processed dried microalgae. Nevertheless, predicted break-even prices are lower than 40 USD per ton of dried microalgae in the base case scenario, which is at least 10 times cheaper than the current best scenario for microalgal biomass production. These low prices are a major impediment to the viability of these thermochemical polygeneration plants, albeit presenting a good potential toward cleaner liquid fuel production.

This pigment is sensitive to pH and this instability results in color change. Thus, phycocyanin fading may become interesting for application in intelligent packaging. The objective of the study was to develop PLA/PEO ultrafine fibers containing phycocyanin to be used as pH indicators membranes for food packaging. The ultrafine fibers were formed by electrospinning process. The average diameter of 1318 nm was obtained for PLA/PEO ultrafine fibers with 2% (w.v(-1)) of phycocyanin and 921 nm for those developed with 3% (w.v(-1)) of the dye. PLA/PEO ultrafine fibers with 3% (w.v(-1)) of the phycocyanin presented the best responses regarding the perception of color change (Delta E). With the highest thickness (68.7 mu m) of the ultrafine fibers developed from 3% (w.v(-1)) of phycocyanin, the Delta E value found was 18.85 to the variation of pH 3 to 4 and for variation from pH 5 to 6 the value of Delta E was 18.66. Thus, the use of PLA/PEO ultrafine fibers containing phycocyanin as pH indicator is an innovative application for intelligent packaging, since the color of pigment changes depending on pH variation.

A system composed of a photobioreactor connected to an absorption column was tested. Two continuous systems were operated with real biogas. One with biogas containing 1800-3500 ppm(v) of H2S, another one without H2S. The tested system provided 98% and 100% removal levels for CO2 and H2S, respectively. Removal of H2S was the result of oxidation to sulfate, as a consequence of the high concentration of dissolved oxygen. Comparison of both systems showed no signs of inhibition due to H2S presence in the biogas. It is concluded then that a microalgae-based biogas upgrading system would not only provide conditions for CO2 removal, but also for H2S oxidation. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

The proposed method was validated and used to characterize two Chlorophyceae, Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus abliquus, and two Cyanobacteria, Aphanothece microscopica Nageli and Phormidium autumnale. The compounds were extracted with a reduced amount of organic solvent mixture (methanol-chloroform), compared to the reference method, under different conditions of homogenization and/or cell disruption. The NPC were derivatized by acid catalysis, whereas the PC fraction was derivatized using N-methyl,N-tert-Butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) in alkaline medium. The following parameters for method validation were considered: selectivity, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), precision, and accuracy. All methods of homogenization and cell disruption extracted both PC and NPC from Chlorophyceae and Cyanobacteria. Derivatization of PC presented satisfactory validation parameters. Eleven fatty acids, six free amino acids, and three organic acids were found within the evaluated microalgae species, succinic, malic, and citric acids, important intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

LES 18 biomass and characterized by functional aspects for food application. Proteins were solubilized at pH 11 and precipitated at pH 4.2 (protein isoelectric point determined by potentiometric titration), with the aid of a high-speed homogenizer. With this procedure, it was possible to obtain a protein concentrate with 83.9 +/- 1.7 wt% of protein and a protein isolate with 91.3 +/- 1.2 wt%. Protein extraction from this microalga allowed a significant increase in protein solubility and foam stability. Furthermore, proteins from both concentrate and isolate presented higher resistance to thermal denaturation than the original proteins of Spirulina sp. LEB 18 biomass. These results show the application potential of the concentrate and the protein isolate from Spirulina sp. LEB 18 in foods for protein supplementation, since they have > 80 and 90% protein, respectively. Industrial relevance text Using proteins from microalgal sources can serve as a sustainable alternative to meet world food demand. The isoelectric precipitation extraction method can be applied on a large scale, achieving high yields. Protein extracts present potential application in specific foods for protein supplementation. Protein extraction can be allied to other biocomposites extraction, such as carbohydrates and lipids for biofuels production.;[Pereira, Aline Massia| Lisboa, Cristiane Reinaldo| Vieira Costa, Jorge Alberto] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Lab Biochem Engn, Av Italia Km 8,Campus Carreiros, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, Brazil;Costa, JAV (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Lab Biochem Engn, Av Italia Km 8,Campus Carreiros, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, Brazil.;jorgealbertovc@terra.com.br;Costa, Jorge A V/L-3999-2013;Costa, Jorge A V/0000-0001-8042-7642;Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)CAPES| National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [454874/2014-6]| Ministry of Science Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) [01200.005005/2014-49];This work was supported by Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) (Project 454874/2014-6) and Ministry of Science Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) (Project 01200.005005/2014-49).;;69;10;10;1;14;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1466-8564;1878-5522;;INNOV FOOD SCI EMERG;Innov.

As different carotenoids have distinct properties and the carotenoid composition of microalgae has been poorly explored in the literature, this study determined the complete carotenoid composition of two microalgae species, Heterochlorella luteoviridis and Dunaliella tertiolecta, using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD/MS2). Additionally, the proximate composition and major minerals were evaluated. RESULTSThe carotenoid composition of the two microalgae was similar, with 13 carotenoids being found in H. luteoviridis and 12 in D. tertiolecta. The major carotenoids were all-trans-lutein (1.18mgg(-1) in H. luteoviridis and 1.59mgg(-1) in D. tertiolecta), all-trans-violaxanthin (0.52mgg(-1) in H. luteoviridis and 0.45mgg(-1) in D. tertiolecta) and all-trans--carotene (0.50mgg(-1) in H. luteoviridis and 0.62mgg(-1) in D. tertiolecta). All-trans-lutein was the predominant carotenoid in both microalgae, representing around 40% (mass fraction) of the total carotenoids. The lutein content found in these microalgae was significantly higher (2-40 times) than that in other important food sources of lutein (e.g. parsley, carrot, red pepper and broccoli). CONCLUSIONThe microalgae H. luteoviridis and D. tertiolecta are excellent sources of lutein that could be commercially exploited by the food and pharmaceutical industries. Moreover, it was confirmed that both microalgae are good sources of protein, lipids and calcium.

The free and immobilized enzymes obtained were used to evaluate enzymatic hydrolysis of the polysaccharides of Spirulina. Microfiltration of the crude extracts resulted in an increase in their specific activity and thermal stability at 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C for 24 h, as compared to extracts obtained by SSF and SF. Immobilization of polyurethane purified enzyme produced yields of 332% and 205% for the enzymes obtained by SF and SSF, respectively. Free or immobilized enzymes favor the generation of fermentable sugar, being the application of the purified and immobilized enzymes in the hydrolysis of microalgal polysaccharides considered a promising alternative towards development of the bioethanol production process from microalgal biomass.

Each scenario was analyzed under de perspective of energy allocation (a) and system expansion with avoided product (b). The results showed that with the energy allocation, only C3a and C4a improved the values of baseline scenario (COa) for NEB, in 120% and 72% respectively. When the system expansion is considered, none of the scenarios was better than the respective baseline scenario (Cob), in relation to the NEB. Considering the FER, C3a increased in 3.4% the values of COa, while C3b and C4b increased the values of COb in 54.1% and 28.8%, respectively. In general, system expansion showed the best scenarios: for the NEB COb showed the highest average values while C3b showed the highest average values for the FER. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed control scheme is composed of two layers. On one hand, a lower layer is in charge of tracking a pH set-point by a PI controller plus feedforward compensator, which was used due to its recognized efficiency in industrial control processes. On the other hand, the upper layer calculates optimal pH set-points based on an economic model predictive control approach. The main aim of this control scheme is to maximize profits, computed as the difference between the incomes obtained from the final production sale and the associated production costs (including the environmental impact of the exhausted CO2 losses). For this purpose, two types of models have been used depending on the requirements of each layer. Simulated and experimental results of the proposed hierarchical control architecture are presented, as well as a comparison with a single-layer architecture with constant reference implemented by the controller used in the lower layer of the hierarchical structure.

Efficient algal dewatering strategies are therefore important for minimising energy and costs. Bio-flocculation is a potentially low-cost, low-energy harvesting strategy which can be facilitated by the microbial production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), but must be inducible since productive algal culture generally requires cells to be in suspension. Here we show that algal bio-flocculation can be controllably induced using the protozoan Tetrahymena. As little as 1: 400 starved Tetrahymena to algal cells can be used to initiate rapid bio-flocculation. We demonstrate that stimulators of ryanodine receptors (caffeine and p-chlorocresol) trigger exocytosis in Tetrahymena and that inexpensive physicochemical stimuli (ammonium ions, shifts in pH and salinity) can also be effective. We suggest that triggered EPS secretion by protozoans in the starved state may explain apparently spontaneous bioflocculation of algae in both natural and artificial systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Despite having a high amount of metal in their biomass, the lipids within marine microalgae can be converted into biodiesel. Analyses of 26 chemical elements (Al, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Sn, Sr, Ti, Tl, V, and Zn) were performed by ICP-OES with the goal of quantifying the inorganic content of marine microalgae's biomass. Regardless of the cultivation media used, microalgae presented differences in their chemical element profile. Strains showed a 12.9% to 36.3% mass of analyzed elements per dry biomass, which represent a relatively high percentage for a feedstock used in biofuels. Among the 36 assayed microalgae, Biddulphia sp., Planktolyngbya limnetica, Amphora sp. (1), Navicula sp. (3) and Synechococcus sp. are most indicated for this purpose as they contain a lower concentration of chemical elements when compared to other samples. However, their profile warns that water quality control is needed for toxic metals such as Ba, Cd, and Pb. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluated the influence of temperature and nutrients on lipid contents of cultured species of freshwater microalgae, with a view toward using these lipids for biodiesel production. Two strains of Monoraphidium contortum, a culture containing Chlorella vulgaris and Desmodesmus quadricauda and another strain of Microcystis aeruginosa were maintained in the laboratory for six days, in five culture media: modified ASM-1 (control, with high concentrations of phosphate and nitrate| phosphorus-deficient| non-limiting phosphate| nitrogen-deficient| and non-limiting nitrate). The cultures were then exposed to temperatures of 13 degrees C, 25 degrees C (control) and 37 degrees C for eight days (n= 3). Lipids were extracted by the cold-solvent (methanol and chloroform) method. On average, the highest total lipid yields were observed when the strains were maintained at 13 degrees C and in the non-limiting nitrate medium. The lipid percentage varied depending on the concentration of algal biomass. This study showed that manipulation of controlling factors can increase the lipid concentration, optimizing the total production in order to use this raw material for biodiesel.;[Bohnenberger, Juliana E.| Crossetti, Luciane O.] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, BR-93022000 Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil| [Bohnenberger, Juliana E.| Crossetti, Luciane O.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil;Bohnenberger, JE (corresponding author), Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Av Unisinos 950, BR-93022000 Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil.;bonhju@yahoo.com.br;Crossetti, Luciane/K-5218-2012;Crossetti, Luciane/0000-0002-0049-4229| Bohnenberger, Juliana/0000-0003-4895-1131;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) of BrazilNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [550280/2010-3];We thank the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq, process 550280/2010-3) of Brazil for financial support.

Biomass separation and cell disruption are important steps in biodiesel production from microalgae. In this work, we explored the fundamentals of electroflotation by alternating current (EFAC) with non-consumable electrodes to simultaneously harvest microalgae and disrupt cells from mixed microalgae obtained from waste stabilization ponds. The harvesting efficiency was evaluated using chlorophyll-a and turbidity, which reached removals of 99% and 95%, respectively, during a batch time of 140 min. Cell disruption was evaluated using lipid extraction, and the best results were achieved with a batch time of 140 min, which resulted in a 14% yield.

The experimental data were analyzed by GAB and BET models. The GAB equation showed the best fitting to the experimental data with R-2 approximate to 99% and MRE < 10%. The water surface area values calculated by GAB and BET models were very similar. The isosteric heats were determined by application of Clausius-Clapeyron equation to sorption isotherms obtained from the best-fitting equation. The isosteric heat and the entropy of desorption isotherm presented similar behavior, with a sharp change in an equilibrium moisture content of 10%. The enthalpy-entropy compensation theory was applied to the isotherms, indicating that they are enthalpy-controlled.;[Oliveira, E. G.| Rosa, G. S.| Moraes, M. A.| Pinto, L. A.

Ecotoxicity and phytotoxicity assays were performed using respectively Daphnia magna and Lactuca sativa, whereas the genotoxicity of the wastewaters was assessed by using D. magna and Allium cepa. The results revealed that the major environmental impacts of the studied wastewaters are associated with the high eutrophication potential, due to high N-NH3 (68.8 +/- 25.7 mg L-1), total P (7.71 +/- 2.5 mg L-1), and BOD5 (526.4 +/- 177 mg L-1) values, pathogenic load, and genototoxicity (p < 0.0001). The results also showed that the integrated system (MA + VFCW) was not able to satisfactory reduce the total p values (only 4%). Nevertheless, the MA + VFCW system achieved very promising results for the nitrogen removal, with emphasis on N-NH3 removal (100%) and the highest BOD5 removal (57%). Neither the raw wastewaters nor the treated wastewaters were phytotoxic. The integrated system completely eliminated the ecotoxicity (100%) and genotoxicity (n.s.) of the raw wastewater and showed decontamination potential. Thus, the integrated system emerges as an innovative environmental technology and, with minor adjustments, might be efficiently used in large scale and eventually replace conventional wastewater treatment systems.;[Silveira, Elizandro Oliveira| Machado, ASnio Leandro| Lutterbeck, Carlos Alexandre] Univ Santa Cruz Sul UNISC, Grad Program Environm Technol, Av Independencia 2293, BR-96815900 Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil| [Moura, Daiane| Rieger, Alexandre] Univ Santa Cruz do Sul, Dept Biol & Pharm, Lab Biotechnol & Genet, Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil;Lutterbeck, CA (corresponding author), Univ Santa Cruz Sul UNISC, Grad Program Environm Technol, Av Independencia 2293, BR-96815900 Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil.;enio@unisc.br| carlosalexandre@unisc.br;Rieger, Alexandre/C-1809-2015| Machado, E.

Some species of Desmodesmus, a chlorophyceae microalgae, are considered potential sources of lipids and different cultivation systems, including heterotrophic growth inwastewater, have been proposed. This study evaluated the effect of temperature on heterotrophic growth and lipid productivity of Desmodesmus subspicatus in sugarcane processing wastewater and lipid extraction by supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2). RESULTS: Results indicated lipid production by Desmodesmus subspicatus in the temperature range 15 and 40 degrees C, with the highest lipid productivity (similar to 1100 mg L-1 day(-1)) at 20 degrees C. Lipid extraction yield with SC-CO2 increased from 23 to 45% by increasing pressure from 20 to 30 MPa at 60 degrees C A cell disruption pretreatment (sonication) increased the lipid extraction yield by approximately 17%. Fatty acids profiles of the extracted lipids indicated major fractions of palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (18:1), linoleic acid (18:2), arachidic acid (20:0) and arachidonic acid (20:4). These characteristics are interesting from the viewpoint of biodiesel production. CONCLUSION: Results suggest the feasibility of the heterotrophic production of Desmodesmus subspicatus biomass intended for lipid accumulation using vinasse, followed by SC-CO2 lipid extraction.

To reach that goal, studies have been conducted in batch and in continuous fixed bed column. Kinetic models of pseudo-first order and -second order and equilibrium isotherms of Langmuir and Freundlich were used to predict the metal accumulation behavior by free and immobilized biomass in a batch system. The data were best fit to kinetic model of second order, with coefficients of determination (R-2) greater than 0.98. Free cells were more efficient in the process than alginate pellets and it was not possible to model the results due to the very fast uptake. Equilibrium modelling indicated that both free and immobilized cells, as well as alginate pellets results were best fit to Langmuir equation due to the high R-2 value and similarity with experimental results. Dynamic column tests conducted with Ankistrodesmus sp. and Golenkinia sp. immobilized cells during 8 hours presented 80% efficiency in the removal of the metal, without reaching saturation. The high and fast ability of the microalgae to adsorb lanthanum corroborates their potential large-scale application.;[Correa, Fernanda do Nascimento| Luna, Aderval Severino| Augusto da Costa, Antonio Carlos] Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Inst Quim, Programa PosGrad Engn Quim, Rua San Francisco Xavier,524, BR-20559900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil;da Costa, ACA (corresponding author), Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Inst Quim, Programa PosGrad Engn Quim, Rua San Francisco Xavier,524, BR-20559900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;acosta@uerj.br;Luna, Aderval S/F-7175-2012;Luna, Aderval S/0000-0001-6772-0182;CNPq (Conselho Nacional do Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico) through the Produtividade em Pesquisa - PQ ProgramNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [302907/2015-7];The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by CNPq (Conselho Nacional do Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico) through the Produtividade em Pesquisa - PQ 2015 Program, Grant 302907/2015-7.;;37;9;9;0;19;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0263-6174;2048-4038;;ADSORPT SCI TECHNOL;Adsorpt.

As an alternative, the use of residual water from other activities has been proposed as a culture medium. The goal of this study was to produce Chaetoceros muelleri, Nannochloropsis oculata and Tetraselmis chuii biomass using residual water from an intensive Litopenaeus vannamei biofloc cultivation system and to verify the ammoniacal nitrogen, nitrite, nitrate and orthophosphate consumption. The microalgae cultures were developed until the second day of their stationary phase in the following treatments: 100% f/2 culture media| 100% residual water| residual water diluted 50% with marine water. T. chuii and N. oculata presented the best relative biomass average (576 mg L (1)| 474 mg L (1)) (P > 0.05). All the species completely assimilated the orthophosphate in 2 days. In 10 days, T. chuii and N. oculata assimilated 87% and 85% of nitrate respectively. It can be concluded that residual water from an L. vannamei biofloc cultivation system can be used as an alternative culture medium for T. chuii and N. oculata biomass production.

The aims of this study were to characterize the structure of periphytic microalgal assemblages on different aquatic macrophyte life forms in order to establish similarities between assemblages from nearby sampling sites. We hypothesized that i) aquatic macrophytes with different life forms and morphological characteristics could differently influence the structure of the periphyton| and ii) that the greatest similarity in periphyton composition should be observed among macrophytes that occupy the same sampling site. The study was conducted from 2006 to 2008 in the Thomaz Osterne de Alencar reservoir (Crato City, Ceara State, Brazil) and involved the taxonomic surveying of microalgae attached to five different macrophytes with the application of structural descriptors (richness, abundance, frequency, diversity and equitability). A total of 127 taxa, of which 44% belonged to the Chlorophyta, were identified. The microalgae assemblages showed high species richness on Salvinia auriculata Aubl., a free-floating macrophyte, and large abundance on Apalanthe granatensis (Humb. & Bonpl.) Planch., a submerged anchored macrophyte. ANOVA indicated that periphyton significantly varied among the macrophytes investigated, and nearby sampling sites showed no structural similarities in microalgal assemblages. In general, we can conclude that the structure of periphyton assemblages is influenced by the substrate (i.e., macrophyte organ), as this can not only promote high diversity and equitability but can also be a predictor of dissimilarity in the distribution and frequency of occurrence of microalgae. These results reinforce the findings of other studies that have shown that macrophytes play an important role in structuring the periphyton assemblages.;[Fernandes, Ubirajara L.| de Oliveira, Elaine C.

When compared to the current methods of maintenance and sub-culturing, cryopreservation minimizes labor costs and is an effective method for maintaining a large range of species over long periods with high stability. In order to determine the best cryopreservation method for microalgae species with great biotechnological potential, three freezing protocols were employed using different cryoprotectants (dimethyl sulfoxide-Me2SO| methanol-MeOH). Three marine microalgae species (Thalassiosira weissflogii| Nannochloropsis oculata, and Skeletonema sp.) were cooled by directly plunging into liquid nitrogen (-196A degrees C) and with two-step controlled cooling protocols (-18A degrees C and -80A degrees C pre-treatments). After storage periods ranging from 10 to 120 days, viability was determined by the ability of cells to actively grow again. Results obtained for T. weissflogii showed that this species could be preserved at ultra-low temperature (-196A degrees C) for 10 and 30 days with 10 % Me2SO and 5 % MeOH when employed a controlled cooling protocol (-80A degrees C). N. oculata was successfully cryopreserved either by direct freezing or with controlled cooling protocols. N. oculata samples presented good responses when treated with 5 % Me2SO, 10 % Me2SO, 5 % MeOH and even without any cryoprotectant. Skeletonema sp. did not survive cryopreservation in any of the tested conditions. The results indicate the difficulty in establishing common protocols for different microalgae species, being necessary further studies for a better understanding of cell damages during freezing and thawing conditions for each species.;[Abreu, Ligia| Borges, Lucelia| Abreu, Paulo Cesar] Fundacao Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, Brazil| [Marangoni, Juliano] Fundacao Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Math Stat & Phys, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, Brazil;Abreu, PC (corresponding author), Fundacao Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Cx P 474, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, Brazil.;docpca@furg.br;Borges, Lucelia/ABA-2739-2020| Abreu, Paulo Cesar/A-5145-2013;Abreu, Paulo Cesar/0000-0002-7657-1112;Brazil's Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq);The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by Brazil's Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).

Fluorimetric detection was made after separation of the o-phthaldialdehyde 2-mercaptoethanol (OPA-2MCE) derivatives using a binary gradient elution. Separation of 19 amino acids was achieved with resolution >1.5 in about 39 min at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. RSD of analyses in seawater medium ranged from 0.36% for Orn (0.50 mu mol/L) to 12% for Ile (0.10 mu mol/L). The main constituents of the intracellular dissolved free amino acids (DFAAs) in the exponential growth phase were arginine (Arg), asparagine (Asn), alanine (Ala), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), serine (Ser), glycine (Gly), glutamine (Gln), and leucine (Leu). The major amino acids excreted to the media were valine (Val), Ala, Ser, and Gly. The monolithic phase facilitates the analysis by shortening the separation time and saving solvents and instrumentation costs (indeed conventional HPLC instrumentation can be used, running at lower pressures than those ones used with packed particle columns).;[Pires Penteado, Jose Carlo| Rigobello-Masini, Marilda| Masini, Jorge Cesar] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Quim Fundamental, Inst Quim, BR-05513970 Sao Paulo, Brazil| [Liria, Cleber Wanderlei| Machini Miranda, M.

We have used the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique applied to a variety of spin labels of a hydrophobic nature with different substitutents on the ring (-OH, =O, -N=C=S, -NH3+, and others). The spin label EPR signals were destroyed as a consequence of metabolic processes once the spin probes had entered the cells. The decay time of the EPR signal was regulated by the diffusion mechanism across the polysaccharide sheath, cell wall, and membrane. To discriminate the effect of the polysaccharide sheath from that of the cell wall and membrane, the polysaccharide sheath was removed by ultrasonic treatment. The decay times for the cells without capsule were faster than those for intact cells, and a possible mechanism of interaction involving hydrogen bonds between the spin labels and the -OH groups of the polysaccharide sheath is presented. These were expressed by their diffusion and function coefficients as derived from Ficks' Second Law and the Einstein-Stokes equation and were summarized in terms of diffusion coefficients (D-1) for the capsule medium in the order: =O < -OH < -phe < -H < -N=C=S| and for cell wall and membrane (D-2): -OH < -H < =O < -NH3+ congruent to -phe < -N=C=S. For the friction coefficients (f(1) and f(2)), the order was inverted.

Little is known about the use of high rate algal ponds (HRAP) for post-treating UASB reactors' effluent. This study aimed to evaluate a UASB reactor followed by a HRAP in terms of sewage treatment efficiency and biogas production, during one year at demonstration-scale. The UASB reactor co-treated raw sewage and the harvested microalgal biomass from the HRAP, which was recirculated to the reactor. An identical UASB reactor, treating only raw sewage, was used as control. The results showed an overall removal of 65% COD and 61% N-NH4 in the system. Furthermore, methane yield was increased by 25% after anaerobic co-digestion with microalgae, from 156 to 211 NL CH4 kg(-1) VS. An energy assessment was performed and showed a positive energy balance, with a net ratio of 2.11 to the annual average.;[Vassalle, Lucas| Rosa Machado, Alcino Trindade| Moreira, Camila| Mota, Cesar R.| Passos, Fabiana] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Sanit & Environm Engn, Av Antonio Carlos 6627, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil| [Vassalle, Lucas| Diez-Montero, Ruben| Ferrer, Ivet] Univ Politecn Catalunya BarcelonaTech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, GEMMA Grp Environm Engn & Microbiol, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Bldg D1, E-08034 Barcelona, Spain;Vassalle, L (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Sanit & Environm Engn, Av Antonio Carlos 6627, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.;lvassalle@ufmg.br;Passos, Fabiana/L-1432-2016| Mota, Cesar/I-4365-2013;Passos, Fabiana/0000-0001-7501-988X| Mota, Cesar/0000-0002-3538-8856| Diez-Montero, Ruben/0000-0001-8435-0195;National Council for Scientific and Technological Development from Brazilian Ministry of Education - CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - CAPESCAPES| Foundation for Research of the State of Minas Gerais - FAPEMIG| CNPQNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| CNPQNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [204026/2018-0]| Spanish Ministry of Industry and Economy [FJCI-2016-30997];The authors would like to acknowledge the following organisms for their help and funding: National Council for Scientific and Technological Development from Brazilian Ministry of Education - CNPq| to the Institute of Sustainable Sewage Treatment Plants - INCT ETEs| Sustentaveis and their funders: Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - CAPES| Foundation for Research of the State of Minas Gerais - FAPEMIG| CNPQ and to National Health Foundation - FUNASA from Brasil.

Positive effects range from the exploitation of mineral resources and their local and regional advantages to the use of energy in industry. The Blue Economy incorporates the concept of rethinking industrial processes and seeking a viable biological solution that reduces pollution. Microalgae have been extensively studied due to the potential of using industrial effluents as a source of nutrients, such as the CO2 emitted from thermoelectric plants. The biomass produced by these microorganisms can be fully utilized in a microalgae-based photobiorefinery, which operates under the principle of producing biofuels and high-value co-products while aiming to improve economic viability. This review aims to present the concepts of a microalgae biorefinery from the use of greenhouse gases by applying the fundamentals of the Blue Economy to collaborate to reduce CO2 emissions from thermoelectric plants.;[Vieira Costa, Jorge Alberto| Bastos de Freitas, Barbara Catarina| Lisboa, Cristiane Reinaldo| Santos, Thaisa Duarte] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Biochem Engn Lab, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Ave Italia,Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil| [de Fraga Brusch, Lucio Renato] Zeri Fdn Brazil, Zero Emiss Res & Initiat, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil| [de Morais, Michele Greque] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Lab Microbiol & Biochem, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil;Costa, JAV (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande, Biochem Engn Lab, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Ave Italia,Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.;dqmjorge@furg.br;de Morais, Michele Greque/J-7539-2015| Freitas, Barbara Catarina B F/D-6132-2019| Costa, Jorge A V/L-3999-2013;de Morais, Michele Greque/0000-0001-8920-2896| Freitas, Barbara Catarina B F/0000-0002-5059-4383| Costa, Jorge A V/0000-0001-8042-7642| Duarte Santos, Thaisa/0000-0002-5764-2536;Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)CAPES| National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq);The authors would like to thank the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for financial support.;;103;8;8;1;32;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;1364-0321;1879-0690;;RENEW SUST ENERG REV;Renew.

In batch operation, removal efficiencies ranges of 65 to 70% of COD, 98 to 99% of NH4+ and 69 to 77.5% of PO4-3 after 12 days were recorded. The corresponding figures for continuous flow were from 57 to 61% of COD, 94 to 96% of NH4+ and 65 to 70% of PO4-3 with mean hidraulic retention time of 12 days. Higher rates of CO2 fixation (327-547 mg L-1 d(-1)) and higher biomass volumetric productivity (213-358 mg L-1 d(-1)) were obtained in batch mode. This microalgae-mediated process can be considered promising for bioremediation and valorization of effluents produced by cattle breeding yielding a protein-rich microalgal biomass that could be eventually used as cattle feed.

In addition, this species presents a wide range of commercial interest pigments, such as zeaxanthin, beta-carotene, and other xanthophylls, with potential for several industrial applications. However, most of the research concerning pigment production by N.oculata has been conducted by employing high-cost laboratorial growth media, which makes large-scale pigment production using these microalgae impractical. Considering the high interest and commercial value in microalgae pigments, this study investigates the feasibility of producing pigments by N.oculata using five different low-cost growth media (fertilizers and aquaculture effluents). Nutrient (ammonia, nitrite and phosphate) concentrations, cell abundance, biomass, and the concentration/composition of pigments were measured. The pigment profile of N.oculata showed chlorophyll-a as the dominant pigment, along with violaxanthin, vaucheraxanthin, and lower concentrations of antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin and beta-carotene. Although the highest biomass (516.4 +/- 76.71mg/L) and pigment content (0.98mg/g) were achieved in the laboratory media (f/2), the low-cost media (containing ammonium sulfate, calcium superphosphate and urea) revealed a great potential for the production of pigments, specially chlorophyll-a, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin, due to the high pigment content per unit of biomass.;[Fae Neto, Wladimir Angelino| Borges Mendes, Carlos Rafael| Abreu, Paulo Cesar] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil;Mendes, CRB (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.;crbmendes@gmail.com;Abreu, Paulo Cesar/A-5145-2013| Mendes, Carlos RB/I-1520-2012;Abreu, Paulo Cesar/0000-0002-7657-1112| Mendes, Carlos RB/0000-0001-6875-8860| Fae Neto, Wladimir Angelino/0000-0002-8850-6676;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [407150/2013-7];Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: 407150/2013-7;;48;8;8;2;35;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1355-557X;1365-2109;;AQUAC RES;Aquac.

Therefore, different pretreatment methods were evaluated for the solubilization of microalgae Scenedesmus sp. The anaerobic digestion of biomass hydrolyzed at 150 degrees C for 60 min with sulfuric acid 0.1% v/v showed higher methane yield (204-316 mL methane/g volatile solids applied) compared to raw biomass (104-163 mL methane/g volatile solids applied). The replacement of sulfuric acid with carbonic acid (by bubbling carbon dioxide up to pH 2.0) provided results similar to those obtained with sulfuric acid, reaching solubilization of 41.6% of the biomass. This result shows that part of the flue gas (containing carbon dioxide and other acid gases as well as high temperatures) may be used for the hydrolysis of the residual biomass from microalgae, thus lowering operational costs (e.g., energy consumption and chemical input).;[Marques, Aline de L.| Pinto, Fabiano P.| Araujo, Ofelia Q. de F.| Cammarota, Magali C.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Sch Chem, Ave Athos da Silveira Ramos 149,Bloco E,Sala 200, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil;Cammarota, MC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Sch Chem, Ave Athos da Silveira Ramos 149,Bloco E,Sala 200, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;line.de.luna@hotmail.com| fabianopessanhaufrj@gmail.com| ofelia@eq.ufrj.br| christe@eq.ufrj.br;de Queiroz Fernandes Araujo, Ofelia/E-5247-2013;de Queiroz Fernandes Araujo, Ofelia/0000-0003-4041-7161;Brazilian National Council for Research and Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [405851/2013-8]| Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support in the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ);The authors are grateful for the financial support from Brazilian National Council for Research and Development (CNPq), grant No. 405851/2013-8 and Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support in the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ).;;22;8;8;0;2;INT CENTRE SUSTAINABLE DEV ENERGY WATER & ENV SYSTEMS-SDEWES;ZAGREB;IVANA LUCICA 5, ZAGREB, 10000, CROATIA;1848-9257;;;J SUSTAIN DEV ENERGY;J.

Indirect biophotolysis biohydrogen production from microalgae has been shown recently to be limited by the amount of accumulated biomass during the growth phase. As a result, this study focused on developing a strategy to increase biohydrogen generation via biomass production increase through microalgae cultivation using exhaust gases from diesel engines. In order to achieve that objective, four simultaneous cultures were conducted to compare the growth of microalgae under pure air and emissions injection, in different flow regimes. An indigenous micro algae strain was selected to'be robust under different weather conditions and was identified as Acutodesmus obliquus through rDNA sequence analysis. The results indicate an increase in biomass production of about 2.8 times for the best case of cultivation with emissions in comparison to a compressed air condition. Besides the growth analyses, the potential for treating the hazardous emissions injected into the system was investigated and the data demonstrated that the CO2 and NOx content was substantially reduced, showing that no damage to the microalgae is caused by the diesel engine emissions. Numerical simulation results for the H-2 production indirect biophotolysis demonstrate that there is an optimal rhythm for maximum time averaged H-2 production rate, and that the stoichiometrically limited total H-2 production is augmented by a similar factor to micro algae biomass production increase.

The model allows for the determination of microalgae and hydrogen mass fractions produced by the photobioreactor with respect to time. A Michaelis-Menten type expression is proposed for modeling the rate of hydrogen production, which introduces a mathematical expression to calculate the resulting effect on H-2 production rate after genetically modifying the microalgae species. The so called indirect biophotolysis process was used. Therefore, a singular opportunity was identified to optimize the aerobic (t(1)), to anaerobic (t(2)), stages time ratio of the cycle for maximum H-2 production rate, i.e., the process rhythm. A system thermodynamic optimization is conducted through the complete model equations to find accurately the optimal system operating rhythm for maximum hydrogen production rate, and how wild and genetically modified species compare to each other. The maxima found are sharp, showing up to a similar to 60% variation in hydrogen production rate for t(2,opt) +/- 1 day, which highlights the importance of system operation in optimal rhythm. Therefore, the model is expected to be useful for design, control and optimization of hydrogen production as a source of renewable energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;[Vargas, J. V.

The experiments were designed using a Taguchi L8 experimental array set at two levels of operation, having light intensity (0.85 and 14.5 klux), CO2 (5 and 10%), NaNO3 (0.025 and 0.075 g L-1) and aeration rate (3: 33 and 1.67 vvm) as independent variables and considering biomass productivity and lipid content as response variables. All the experiments were performed in six photobioreactor vessels connected in series with a total volume of 8.4 L and working volumes of 2 L and 4 L, depending on the conditions assessed. The highest biomass productivity was 210.9 mg L-1 day(-1), corresponding to a lipid content of 8.2%. Such results were attained when the culture conditions were set at 0.85 klux light intensity, 5% CO2 and 0.075 g L-1 NaNO3. The aeration rate showed no significant influence on the biomass productivity. On the other hand, the highest lipid content was achieved when the cultures were grown using the lowest concentration of NaNO3 (0.025 g L-1) and an aeration rate of 1.67 vvm, while the other factors had no statistical significance. Under these conditions, the lipid content obtained was 19.8%, at the expense of reducing the biomass productivity to 85.9 mg L-1 day(-1). The fatty acid profile of the lipid material characterized by gas chromatography identified fourteen fatty acids with carbon chain ranging from C8 to C20 in which most of the fatty acids present were saturated (58.7 %) and monounsaturated (36.1%) fatty acids. Those obtained at higher proportions were the oleic (22.8%), palmitic (20.7%) and lauric (17.7 %) acids, indicating a suitable composition for fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) synthesis. This was confirmed by acid catalysis performed under ultrasound irradiations reaching a conversion rate of 78.4% within only 4 h. (C) 2015 BRTeam.

O.;Comparative study of different matrix/solvent systems for the analysis of crude lyophilized microalgal preparations using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry;RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY;English;Article;;IDENTIFICATION| SELECTION;RATIONALEDue to increases in greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to explore renewable sources of energy. Interesting alternatives are biofuels derived from microalgae. One challenge is the development of a detailed microalgae database compiling species identifications and characterizations that would facilitate microalgae selection for biomass production. Mass spectrometric (MS) analysis using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) source is an advanced technique that enables advancement in this biological area. In this work a MALDI time-of-flight (TOF)MS method for the rapid identification of proteins in whole cells of selected microalgae species was studied. Furthermore, the efficiency of different matrix and solvent systems was tested. MS analyses were performed using an UltrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer operating in linear positive ion mode. METHODSMass spectra were acquired in a mass range from 4000 to 20,000 Da with ions generated from Smartbeam laser irradiation using a frequency of 2000 Hz, a PIE 100 ns and a lens 7 kV. The voltage was 25 kV for the first ion source and 23 kV for the second. Each spectrum was generated by averaging of 10,000 laser shots and the laser irradiance was set at 95-100%. RESULTSSimilar mass spectra were obtained for all matrices (SA, HCCA, DHB and sDHB)| however, the use of the sDHB matrix resulted in spectrum profiles with a greater amount number of proteins, a better signal/noise (S/N) ratio and higher intensities for the majority of microalgae analyzed. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) content was also studied and the best results in terms of S/N ratio, number of proteins and signal intensities were obtained with 0.1% TFA in the matrix solvent. The addition of isopropanol did not produce improvement in the quality of spectrum profiles. CONCLUSIONSTherefore, the optimal matrix for the analysis of protein from intact microalgae cells is sDHB with TA50 as the matrix solvent and without isopropanol. These conditions allow the acquisition of high quality spectrum profiles. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;[Andrade, L. M.| Mendes, M. A.| Nascimento, C. A.

HAB events are frequently caused by outbreaks of toxin-producing dinoflagellates, which are subject to top-down control by zooplankton. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of dinoflagellate exudates and intact cells on the survivorship and mobility of zooplankton taxa from a subtropical location (Ubatuba, Brazil). Lethal effects were observed in five out of six taxa investigated, three of which (copepod nauplii, tintinnids and gastropod larvae) when exposed to dinoflagellate exudates and two (rotifers and brachyuran zoeae) when exposed to intact cells. In addition, gastropod larvae displayed mobility impairment during exposure to dinoflagellate exudates. Only polychaete larvae were not apparently affected during the course of the experiments. Zooplankton responses usually varied according to the dinoflagellate species tested. For instance, exudates from Alexandrium tamiyavanichii, Gonyaulax sp. and Gymnodinium sp. decreased survivorship of planktonic copepod nauplii but did not affect bottom-dwelling harpacticoid nauplii, which were in turn killed by exudates from Prorocentrum lima, a epibenthic dinoflagellate. These results suggest that HAB events do not cause indiscriminate zooplankton mortality, but may instead generate community shifts and complex cascading effects through the pelagic and benthic food web. Species-specific monitoring of zooplankton responses to HABs is therefore an important step to understand the ecological implications of dinoflagellate outbreaks in coastal waters, and their impact on marine farming activities.;[Silva, Naira J.| Lopes, Rubens M.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Biol Oceanog, Oceanog Inst, BR-05508120 Sao Paulo, Brazil| [Tang, Kam W.] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA;Lopes, RM (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Biol Oceanog, Oceanog Inst, Praca Oceanog 191, BR-05508120 Sao Paulo, Brazil.;rubens@usp.br;Lopes, Rubens M/C-6335-2012;Lopes, Rubens M/0000-0002-9709-073X;Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2008/50640-8, 2010/04678-3]| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [485167/2007-7, 307928/2010-1];This study was supported by the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP #2008/50640-8 to R.

They provide qualitative and quantitative population changes and have become important in environmental monitoring. The aim of the present study was to assess the sensitivity of the microalgae Thalassiosira weissflogii to water toxicity in the Suape industrial-port complex, and to potassium dichromate in the months of July, September and November of 2010 and January and September of 2011, as well as to compare the microalgae results to those obtained in tests with the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. The chronic toxicity tests with both species followed standardized methods. Once the exposure period was completed, the population increase of the algae was assessed using cell density and growth rate data and the percentage of L. variegatus pluteus larvae revealing normal and aberrant development was determined. The algal growth and percentage of pluteus results demonstrated that toxicity in the studied area varied according to the month. The present study confirmed that the best timeframe to conclude tests with the microalgae T. weissflogii was 72 h. The microalgae cell density results after 72 h were sufficient to assess the toxicity of surface water samples and were more sensible than the growth rates. The microalgae T. weissflogii was a sensitive test-organism for seawater toxicity. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;[Araujo, C. F. C.| Souza-Santos, L.

All possible applications are directly linked to growth rate and the chemical profile of the species. Thus, the selection of conditions to promote a better use of algal biomass is fundamental for economic purposes. In this study, 10 species of marine microalgae were cultured and compared for growth and chemical composition. Remarkable differences of growth performance have been observed, with species with small cell volumes growing faster than species with large cell volumes. Levels of protein. carbohydrate. lipid and photosynthetic pigments varied widely, and proteins were identified as the most abundant substances. Some species showed high concentrations of fatty acids of economic importance, such as eicosapentaenoic and linoleic acids. The conceit, rations of amino acids were similar among species. In all microalgae, glutamic and aspartic acids were the most abundant amino acids. An overall evaluation of the results indicates that few general trends related to the taxonomy of algal groups were recognized.;[Campos, Viviane Borges| Barbarino, Elisabete| Lourenco, Sergio de Oliveira] Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Biol Marinha, Lab Fisiol & Cult Algas, BR-24001970 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil;Campos, VB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Biol Marinha, Lab Fisiol & Cult Algas, Campus Valonguinho,CP 100644, BR-24001970 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.;borgescamposv@yahoo.com.br;;;;;;28;8;9;0;22;UNIV FEDERAL SANTA MARIA;SANTA MARIA;CIDADE UNIV, BAIRRO CAMOBI, SANTA MARIA, RS 97105-900, BRAZIL;0103-8478;1678-4596;;CIENC RURAL;Cienc.

Microalgae were cultured in 500 L fiberglass tanks, under temperature of 20 +/- 2 C, Guillard f/2 culture medium, and continuous light intensity of 203-226 mu mol photons/m(2)/sec. Cultures were centrifuged at 2000 g at the exponential growth phase. Microalgae cell quality after centrifugation and during storage was determined by analyses with Evan's blue stain and by counting the number of total marine bacteria. Treatments with and without additive were applied to the microalgae paste produced, which was distributed into 100 mL plastic containers, capped, and stored under refrigeration at 4 +/- 1 C. Results indicated that in the Chaetoceros muelleri paste, centrifugation did not damage the cells and the number of total marine bacteria reduced significantly from 2.9 x 10(6) to 8.3 x 10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter. Chaetoceros muelleri and Chaetoceros calcitrans pastes stored with addition of 0.1% ascorbic acid had a shelf life shorter than 2 wk. For the treatment without additive, results with Evan's blue stain showed that cells (99%) remained viable until the sixth week of storage for C. muelleri and seventh week of storage for Skeletonema sp. and C. calcitrans. The number of bacteria did not increase during storage for C. calcitrans and Skeletonema (P > 0.05). For C. muelleri, an increase in bacteria (P < 0.05) was observed after the sixth week of storage. This study demonstrated the feasibility to produce and store microalgae paste for a period of 2-8 wk, which allows it to be used as food source and also optimizes the use of microalgae cultured in laboratory.;[Ferreira, Jaime Fernando| Yasumaru, Fanny] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, LMM, Dept Aquicultura, BR-88061600 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [Nunes, Moira] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Programa Posgrad Aquicultura, LMM, BR-88061600 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [Pereira, Adriana] EPAGRI Empresa Pesquisa Agropecuaria & Extensao R, BR-88034901 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil;Ferreira, JF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, LMM, Dept Aquicultura, Servidao Coroas S-N, BR-88061600 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;;;Yasumaru, Fanny/0000-0003-1265-3458;CAPES (Coordenacao Permanente de Pessoal Docente)CAPES| FINEP (Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos)Ciencia Tecnologia e Inovacao (FINEP)| FAPESC (Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa e Extencao de Santa Catarina);We thank Claudio Manuel Rodrigues de Melo for the assistance provided with the statistical analyses and the financing agencies CAPES (Coordenacao Permanente de Pessoal Docente), FINEP (Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos) and FAPESC (Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa e Extencao de Santa Catarina).;;48;8;8;0;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0893-8849;1749-7345;;J WORLD AQUACULT SOC;J.

During the period of September 2005 to October 2006, three Litopenaeus vannamei ponds and the affluent channel were analyzed by taking biweekly samples of phytoplankton and phytobenthics. In the ponds were recorded informations about the hydrological variables, weather, culture parameters and the production data. The Cyanophyta dominated the phytoplankton in all cycles, reaching the relative abundance of 80%, the Pseudoanabaena genus was mainly responsible for this domination. The Bacillariophyta dominated the phytobenthics, with abundance over 85%. The phytoplankton reached higher densities in the ponds, whereas the phytobenthics was dominant in the affluent channel.

This study uses molecular methods and flow cytometry to assess the cyanobacterial and eukaryotic communities longitudinally throughout two systems, one treating domestic wastewater and the other mixed industrial/domestic wastewaters. More variation was seen between the systems than between different stages in the treatment processes for both eukaryotic and cyanobacterial communities. Chlorella species and Planktophrix cyanobacteria dominated both treatment systems. Arthrospira cyanobacteria were detected only in the industrial/domestic system. The balance between non-photosynthetic and photosynthetic organisms is rarely considered, though both play vital roles in WSP functioning. Flow cytometry showed that the facultative and first maturation pond in the industrial system contained a lower proportion of photosynthetic organisms compared to the domestic system. This is reflected in the species richness data and low dissolved oxygen levels detected. All data indicated that both systems are significantly different from one another and that variation longitudinally throughout the systems is lower. A more systematic study is needed to determine if it is the wastewater source rather than the initial inoculum that drives community composition.

Hence, the present research focuses extraction of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds from Scenedesmus subspicatus using solvents of different polarities. Different solvents such as ethanol, methanol, butanol, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide, and water were used to extract compounds from the green microalgae S. subspicatus and then they were examined for phytochemical screening, antioxidant activity, and antimicrobial properties. In vitro free radical quenching and total antioxidant activity of extracts were investigated with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl and compared with catequin and gallic acid as positive controls. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Aqueous extracts and dimethyl sulfoxide presented better performance in phytochemical analysis. This result showed consistency in the sequential tests. The antioxidant activity was also better using the two solvents cited above. The extracts acetone, water, and dimethyl sulfoxide showed ability to inhibit the growth of Bacillus subtilis. However, only dimethyl sulfoxide inhibited the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Use of the aqueous extract, proven its effectiveness, is an economic protocol and avoids the use of toxic substances.;[de Macedo Dantas, Danielli Matias] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco UFRPE, Lab Biotecnol Microalgas, Unidade Acad Serra Talhada, Serra Talhada, Brazil| [Barbosa de Oliveira, Carlos Yure] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, LCA, Servidao Coroas S-N, BR-88061600 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [Pedrosa Brandao Costa, Romero Marcos| das Gracas Carneiro-da-Cunha, Maria| Bezerra, Ranilson de Souza] Univ Fed Pernambuco UFPE, Dept Bioquim, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Recife, PE, Brazil| [Galvez, Alfredo Olivera] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco UFRPE, Lab Prod Alimento Vivo, Dept Pesca & Aquicultura, Recife, PE, Brazil;de Oliveira, CYB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, LCA, Servidao Coroas S-N, BR-88061600 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;yureboliveira@gmail.com;de Oliveira, Carlos Yure Barbosa/V-1726-2019| Costa, Romero Marcos Pedrosa Brandao/AAP-9059-2020;de Oliveira, Carlos Yure Barbosa/0000-0001-9237-1869| Costa, Romero Marcos Pedrosa Brandao/0000-0001-7045-2975;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE)| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)CAPES| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq);The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) and finally, the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico for the Productivity Research Grant offered to Ranilson de Souza Bezerra and Alfredo Olivera Galvez.;;44;7;7;2;14;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1082-0132;1532-1738;;FOOD SCI TECHNOL INT;Food Sci.

In the present study, the environmental impacts generated by the application of 1 kg of nitrogen from the algal biomass (biofertilizer) were analyzed through life cycle analysis. Nitrogen was recovered from a meat processing industry effluent in a high-rate algal pond. Impacts related to the entire biofertilizer chain were mainly impacting on climate changes (115 kgCO(2)eq). Other categories (particle formation, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication and freshwater ecotoxicity) were not very representative. Biomass cultivation was the most critical step regarding energy and time consumption. On the other hand, the use of effluent as the culture medium for microalgae growth reduced impact categories, such as freshwater eutrophication. Results showed that microalgae cultivation and harvesting steps need to be technologically developed, especially when compared to a conventional fertilizer already established in the market. In order to make microalgae biofertilizer environmental advantageous, alternatives should be beforehand: i) the use of photovoltaic energy instead of hydropower energy| ii) the use of a nitrogen richer effluent| iii) and the consideration of an environmental compensation for the treatment of effluent can be accounted for, disregarding the biomass production stage.

In this work, a pyrolysis process using solar energy was studied for the production of bio-oil from Chlarnydomonas reinharddi microalgae. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to evaluate the effects of biomass loading rate, reaction time, and percentage of hydrotalcite catalyst on the product distribution and liquid composition. Equations were proposed for predicting products yields as a function of the studied variables. Optimum conditions for maximum liquid yield (57%) were identified using the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. The optimal conditions for the liquid yield were 1.98 g, 9.9 min, and 22.88% for the biomass loading rate, reaction time and catalyst percentage, respectively.

A microwave synthesis instrument is used, and time and temperature are optimized using a central composite design. A chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1v/v) is used as extractor solvent and the ideal condition is 1min of microwave irradiation at 80 degrees C using power mode at 300W. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows extensive cell damage leading to cracking, fragmentation, and large debris in a shorter treatment time. In addition, the fatty acids profile shows that microwave irradiation method has no degrading effect on the extracted fatty acids. The extraction by microwave achieves a significantly higher yield (33.62.6%) with only 1min of extraction time than conventional ultrasonic extraction (20min, 25 degrees C, 28.510.8% yield) from wet Nannochloropsis oculata biomass. Next, the efficiency of the extraction method in is evaluated in terms of species variation by applying it to the algal paste of Amphora coffeaeformis, Chaetoceros gracilis, and Isochrysis galbana. The lipid content obtained from A. coffeaeformis, C. gracilis, and I. galbana is 16.27 +/- 1.5, 22.31 +/- 2.5, and 19.87 +/- 2.4%, respectively. Thus, the microwave method is successfully applied to algal paste.Practical Applications: The microalgal cell wall disruption is an important and complex stage and effective methods of disruption are fundamental to extracting lipids. This study shows an easy, quick, and efficient microwave method for application in routine laboratory extraction of lipids from wet microalgae pastes. A microwave compact instrument is used and the ideal condition is 1min of microwave irradiation. The method proves to be robust against variation in mass achieved and significantly higher yield in a shorter time than ultrasonic extraction (conventional method). The microalgal cell disruption is an important and complex stage. The use of microwaves to induce cell disruption in wet biomass proves to be efficient for lipid extraction with only 1min of extraction time. The method is applied successfully to wet microalgae pastes with different cell walls and the microwave radiation does not degrade the extracted fatty acids.;[de Moura, Renata R.| Etges, Bianca J.| dos Santos, Elisane O.| Martins, Tatiana G.| Primel, Ednei G.| D'Oca, Marcelo G.

In these ecosystems, the phytoplankton is immersed in a complex matrix of nutrients, excreted materials, and other chemical compounds, which can influence the metabolic strategy of microalgae. One of the metabolic ways is mixotrophy, a situation whereby microalgae perform photosynthesis and use dissolved organic carbon at the same time. Most toxicity evaluations do not consider such a metabolic route, but this can represent a preferential metabolism in natural environments. The present study aimed at evaluating the effects of NP-TiO2 at a log concentration range of -3.10 to 0.89, on photosynthesis, growth, viability, and biochemical composition of the microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana during photoautotrophic and mixotrophic growth (glucose as the organic carbon source). The results showed lower chlorophyll a and photosynthetic activity in mixotrophy than in photoautotrophy, which can be due to a decreased need for photosynthesis in mixotrophy. Photoautotrophy cultures were sensitive to NPs, reaching 39% of viability at log 0.89, while in mixotrophy, cell viability was not affected by NPs. The biochemical composition and cell density changed as a function of NP concentrations, with increase in the protein/carbohydrate ratio in both treatments. The results showed that C. sorokiniana is more resistant to NPs during mixotrophic growth, but with changes in biochemical composition, whereas the photoautotrophic cultures were more sensitive to the increase in NP concentrations.;[Marchello, Adriano Evandir| Barreto, Daniela Mariano| Lombardi, Ana Teresa] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Lab Algal Biotechnol, Dept Bot, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235,SP 310, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| [Marchello, Adriano Evandir| Barreto, Daniela Mariano] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Postgrad Ecol & Nat Resources, Ctr Biol & Hlth Sci, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235,SP 310, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil;Marchello, AE (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Postgrad Ecol & Nat Resources, Ctr Biol & Hlth Sci, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235,SP 310, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;driecologia@gmail.com;;Marchello, Adriano/0000-0002-1292-4660;Brazilian agency FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2014/15894-0]| CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [302175/2015-6];The authors thank the Brazilian agency FAPESP (Proc.

This study evaluated serum levels of metabolic markers and reproductive performance of sows supplemented with the heterotrophic microalgae Schizochytium sp. Sows (n = 596) were supplemented from the 85th day of gestation, during lactation and until the weaning-estrous interval (WEI). Microalgae were included at five levels: 0 (control)| 3.5| 7.0| 14.0| and 28.0 g/d. Blood samples were collected at the 85th day of gestation, at the 10th d of lactation and at the last day prior to weaning (WEI). Serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin-like growth factor type-1 (IGF-1) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were evaluated. At the parity concurrent with the supplementation, no effects were observed on stillborn rates (P > 0.05), sows fed 28.0 g/d farrowed heavier piglets than sows fed lower levels (P < 0.05), but the WEI for sows fed 7.0 g/d was longer than for the control (P < 0.05). Serum levels of triglycerides were decreased during gestation, only for sows supplemented with 14.0 and 28.0 g/d (P < 0.05). At the subsequent parity, there was no difference on stillborn rates and total litter size (P > 0.05). The highest tested concentration (28.0 g/d) of Schizochytium sp. was associated with reduced serum levels of triglycerides during gestation and with increased piglet birth weight, but the supplementation generally did not benefit sow reproductive performance.;[Posser, C.

The soil was contaminated with 4% of diesel or biodiesel and biostimulated with phycocyanin (a proteic emulsifier extracted from the Spirulina platensis biomass), an inactive biomass of S. platensis, or ammonium sulfate. Experiments were conducted for 60 days, whereas the biodegradation was measured through the determination of carbon dioxide (CO2) evolution and oils and grease. Higher CO2 evolution was observed in the soil contaminated with the biodiesel and phycocyanin as biostimulant (2,997.35 mg C-CO2) and in the soil contaminated with diesel oil with the inactive biomass S. platensis as biostimulant (2,454.89 mg C-CO2). The highest biodegradation was achieved by using phycocyanin as a biostimulant for biodiesel contamination (88.75%) or inactive biomass of S. platensis (63.89%) for diesel as contaminant. Natural attenuation resulted in the lower CO2 evolution of 386.5 and 282.5 mg C-CO2 and biodegradation rates of 42.4 and 31.3% for biodiesel and diesel, respectively.

To date, no correlation between STX concentrations and phytoplankton physiology has been reported. We investigated the effect of STX (STX+, 0.5-10 mu g L (-1) total STX) and non-STX (STX-, 0.5-10 mu g L (-1) total STX biomass equivalent) extracts of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii on Microcystis wesenbergii BCCUSP11, Microcystis aeruginosa BCCUSP232 (microcystin producing), Scenedesmus acuminatus UFSCar036, and Monoraphidium convolutum CMEA/UFF0201 under controlled laboratory conditions. Both STX+ and STX- extracts inhibited the cell density and specific growth rate of M. wesenbergii, M. aeruginosa, and S. acuminatus. However, the effect of STX+ extract on the phytoplankton strains was significantly higher than that of STX- extract. M. convolutum, on the other hand, was tolerant as both STX+ and STX- extracts did not significantly reduce its cell density and specific growth rate (day(-1)). The exposure of M. aeruginosa to STX+ and STX- resulted in higher total (intracellular and extracellular) microcystin concentration than the control. STX concentrations had a significant negative correlation with cell density and growth response of the phytoplankton strains investigated in this study. Conclusions can be made that although both STX+ and STX- extracts of C. raciborskii inhibited the growth of some phytoplankton species, the STX+ extracts were more toxic.;[Bittencourt-Oliveira, Maria do Carmo| Chia, Mathias Ahii| Camargo-Santos, Danilo] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Biol Sci, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil| [Camargo-Santos, Danilo] Sao Paulo State Univ, Inst Biol Sci, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil| [Dias, Carlos T.

Among the seven species examined, Chlorella minutissima and Arthrospira platensis showed biodiesel production potential, while fatty acids from Chlorella vulgaris, Cyclotella sp., Cylindrotheca closterium, Entomoneis alata, and A. platensis have great economic values, with application in the pharmaceutical and food industries. The oxidative stability of the biodiesel produced from C. minutissima will be high, but there will be problems with cold filter plugging point temperatures. These can be solved by mixing C. minutissima biodiesel with a biodiesel like that from Ankistrodesmus gracilis that is rich in di- or tri-unsaturated fatty acids. Triacylglyceride analysis made it possible to tell if a microalgae oil is composed mainly of triacylglycerides or of some other class of lipids. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.;[Soares, A. T.| Silva, B.

The application of experimental designs for microalgae cultivation is difficult, since experiments involving such microorganisms generally last days or weeks. This work proposes a multipurpose laboratory apparatus for the optimization of microalgae experimental conditions that simultaneously enables the evaluation of variables such as temperature, irradiance, photoperiod and CO2 concentration in the aeration stream, as well as variables related to the concentration of culture media nutrients. A case study is also presented in which temperature, concentration of f/2 medium sodium nitrate and the effects of incident light intensity on Nannochloropsis oculata lipid content are evaluated. Experiments were carried out following central composite designs, in batch cultivation within an airlift photobioreactor apparatus. The best experimental result was obtained at 21 degrees C, 119 mg/L NaNO3 and 137 mu E.m(-2).s(-1), corresponding to 41.8% lipids and 211.9 mg.L-1 final lipid concentrations.;[Gris, L. R.

Cell polysaccharide fractions were analyzed for chemical composition, and we performed a comparison of the lipid components between cultures subjected to either a light/dark cycle of 12 h/12 h or 24 h of light. Man, Rha and Gal were the main monosaccharides in the EXO fraction. Following the purification step, the EXO fraction yielded EXO1.0 and EXO1.5 fractions. A linkage analysis of the EXO1.0 fraction indicated the presence of a highly branched polysaccharide with a (1 -> 4)-linked mannan backbone, and analysis of EXO1.5 indicated the presence of a complex rhamnan consisting mainly of 2- and 4-linked Rha units with the non-reducing end of Gal and Rha. In cultures subjected to a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle, palmitic and myristic acids were the most abundant lipids, and no polyunsaturated acid was detected. However, in cultures subjected to 24 h of light, no myristic acid was detected, and stearic and palmitic acids were the most abundant fatty acids. A polyunsaturated fatty acid and fatty acids with 20 or more carbon atoms also occurred in this fraction.;[Lopes, Daniella Cristine| Baron Maurer, Juliana Bello| Zawadzki-Baggio, Selma Faria] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, BR-81530900 Curitiba, PR, Brazil| [Stevan-Hancke, Fabiola Regina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Sch Med, BR-80215030 Curitiba, PR, Brazil| [de Oliveira Proenca, Luis Antonio] Fed Inst Santa Catarina, BR-88301306 Itajai, SC, Brazil;Zawadzki-Baggio, SF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, POB 19046, BR-81530900 Curitiba, PR, Brazil.;sfzb@ufpr.br;Stevan-Hancke, Fabiola Regina/C-8959-2013| Maurer, Juliana Bello Baron/F-8620-2012| Zawadzki Baggio, Selma/B-6817-2013;Stevan-Hancke, Fabiola Regina/0000-0003-3197-1419| Maurer, Juliana Bello Baron/0000-0001-6235-331X| ;CAPESCAPES| CNPq/Fundacao Araucaria (PRONEX-Carboidratos)Fundacao Araucaria;This research was supported by CAPES and CNPq/Fundacao Araucaria (PRONEX-Carboidratos).;;61;7;7;0;33;WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH;BERLIN;GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY;0006-8055;1437-4323;;BOT MAR;Bot.

Owing to the small volumes, onsite treatment options and potential environmental risks posed to aquatic ecosystems due to discharge of these wastewaters are seldom investigated. In the present study, the effects of cleaning wastewater streams generated at two wood floor production lines on Desmodesmus subspicatus were investigated. The microalgae was exposed to different wastewater concentrations (100, 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25% v:v) and the algae growth evaluation was based on in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence, cell density, cell size (number of cells/colony) and cell ratio (length/width). Inhibitory effects of the tested wastewaters on the microalgae were positively related to concentration and negatively related to exposure time. The EC50,24 h of blade cleaning wastewater (BCW) and floor cleaning wastewater (FCW) were 3.36 and 5.87% (v:v), respectively. No negative effect on cell colony formation was caused by BCW, whereas an increase of 90% unicellular cells was observed in FCW concentrations below 50% (v:v). At the lowest concentration (3.13% v:v) where no growth inhibition was observed, both wastewater streams caused changes in cell dimensions by increasing cell length and width. To conclude, wastewaters generated during cleaning procedures in the wood floor industries can have severe environmental impacts on aquatic organisms, even after high dilution. Therefore, these wastewaters must be treated before being discharged into water bodies.;[Laohaprapanon, S.| Kaczala, F.| Marques, M.| Hogland, W.] Linnaeus Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Kalmar, Sweden| [Salomon, P.

The microalgae biomass can then be used as fertilizer to enrich impoverished agricultural soils by increasing the soil's carbon content and providing essential nutrients for soil health. Using microalgae for wastewater treatment will enable the shift from linear sanitation systems to circular ones where the carbon and nutrient cycles can be closed. By using a nutrientrich wastewater medium for microalgae cultivation, high biomass productivity and, therefore, high nutrient recovery, can be achieved. In this study, we demonstrated that Chlorella sorokiniana and Chlorococcum sp. were able to grow in and remove nitrogen and phosphorus from anaerobically-digested black water (AnBW), in a 211 L tubular photobioreactor (PBR), placed in a temperature-controlled (25 degrees C) glass greenhouse, under Dutch natural light conditions (5.8 to 23.3 mol photons.m(-2).d(-1) and 67 to 270 mu mol.s(-1). m(-2)). The microalgae productivity varied from 0.13 g DW.L-1.d(-1) (autumn) to 0.36 g DW.L-1.d(-1) (summer). The nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates were 28 to 62 mg.L-1.d(-1) and 2.3 to 5.4 mg.L-1.d(-1), respectively. Due to the insufficient light availability for the high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of the AnBW cultivation medium (1280 mg.L-1 and 68 mg.L-1, respectively), the overall nutrient removal efficiencies remained below 50% even during the summer period when light intensity was at its highest. Partial nitrification was confirmed by the accumulation of nitrite (>= 1000 mg NO2-N.L-1) in the PBR. These high NO2 concentrations did not, however, hinder microalgae growth. The macronutrient and trace element compositions of the dry microalgal biomass were similar to commercially available organic fertilizers, indicating a potential for soil enrichment.;[Silva, Gustavo H.

Under this horizon, this study evaluates the prospects for large-scale, integrated sugarcane-microalgae biorefineries in terms of their techno-economic and environmental feasibility, as well as the possible benefits brought by the RenovaBio program. Process integration was based on different energy and material vectors obtained from the sugarcane mill, especially the use of fermentation-derived CO2, CO2 in biogas, and vinasse as carbon sources for microalgae growth. Results show that the co-location of microalgae production with sugarcane mills leads to verticalized biorefineries currently behind in economic performance in comparison to conventional sugarcane mills due to an increase in both fixed and operational expenses. Anhydrous ethanol production costs remain in the range of US$ 0.36-0.42/L, below the market price of US$ 0.51/L. Integrating a microalgae facility with a sugarcane mill also helps to further improve the sustainability of anhydrous ethanol production: cradle-to-grave emissions of greenhouse gases fluctuate around 18 g CO(2)eq/MJ, a reduction of 15% in comparison to conventional sugarcane-based ethanol. Depending on the scenario, a reasonably-sized integrated biorefinery would be able to mitigate around 500 thousand t CO(2)eq/year when displacing gasoline with anhydrous ethanol. The analysis finally points out to integrated sugarcane-microalgae biorefineries becoming economically feasible at carbon prices as low as US$ 10/t CO(2)eq under the RenovaBio scheme.;[Klein, Bruno Colling| Chagas, Mateus Ferreira| Barbosa Watanabe, Marcos Djun| Bonomi, Antonio] Brazilian Ctr Res Energy & Mat CNPEM, Brazilian Biorenewables Natl Lab LNBR, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil| [Klein, Bruno Colling| Chagas, Mateus Ferreira| Maciel Filho, Rubens] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Fac Chem Engn, Lab Optimizat Design & Adv Control LOPCA, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil;Klein, BC (corresponding author), Brazilian Biorenewables Natl Lab LNBR, CP 6170, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil.;bruno.klein@gmail.com;;Watanabe, Marcos D.B./0000-0001-9818-7405;LNBR - Brazilian Biorenewables National Laboratory (CNPEM/MCTIC);Research supported by LNBR - Brazilian Biorenewables National Laboratory (CNPEM/MCTIC) during the use of the Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery (VSB) open access facility.;;89;6;6;4;10;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;1364-0321;1879-0690;;RENEW SUST ENERG REV;Renew.

Biomass and metabolite productivities of photoautotrophic algae cultures are low because of limited availability of light. Therefore, mixotrophic cultures were investigated in parallel with photoautotrophic controls. In mixotrophy, some of the energy and carbon are supplied in the form of dissolved organic substrates in addition to inorganic carbon and light being available. The aim was to compare productivities of biomass, fatty acids, and carotenoid pigments in outdoor and indoor mixotrophic and photoautotrophic batch and continuous cultures. The edible and safe marine microalga Nannochloropsis gaditana was used in these studies. The alga could be grown mixotrophically using glucose and glycerol, but not acetate. Optimal concentrations of the organic carbon sources were 5 g L-1 for glucose and 1 g L-1 for glycerol. Mixotrophy substantially increased the biomass concentration and productivity relative to photoautotrophy. The maximum biomass productivity in mixotrophic batch cultures using glucose or glycerol was identical at 170 mg L-1 day(-1), being 30% greater than control cultures. In continuous outdoor culture with glucose (5 g L-1) mixotrophy at 12 degrees C, the total carotenoids in the biomass were 83% higher compared to photoautotrophic control biomass, and the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) productivity was 2.2-fold higher relative to controls. The maximum EPA productivity was 11 mg L-1 day(-1). Glucose mixotrophy increased the total lipids content in the biomass by 34% relative to photoautotrophic operation.;[Menegol, T.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Food Sci & Technol Inst, ZC, Av Bento Gonsalves 9500, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil| [Romero-Villegas, G., I| Lopez-Rodriguez, M.| Navarro-Lopez, E.| Lopez-Rosales, L.| Ceron-Garcia, M.

Vinasse acted as the biopolymer solvent, providing greater stability to pectin gel, and as a source of nitrogen (N), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). LMBR (0.5%) was considered a complementary source of N and micronutrients, copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). Compared to blank pectin particles, the particles with vinasse and LMBR showed homogeneous polymer matrix, spherical shapes, higher soluble matter release and enhanced mechanical properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis indicated the incorporation of microalgal biomass and nutrients from vinasse. Higher rates of biodegradation as well as larger degree of mineralization were found over a period of 36 days for vinasse and LMBR particles.

However, this process is limited by the hydrolytic stage, due to the complex and resistant microalgae cell wall components. This fact hinders biomass conversion into biogas, demanding the application of pretreatment techniques for inducing cell damage and/or lysis and organic matter solubilisation. In this study, sonication, thermal, ultrasound, homogeneizer, hydrothermal and steam explosion pretreatments were evaluated in different conditions for comparing their effects on anaerobic digestion performance in batch reactors. The results showed that the highest biomass solubilisation values were reached for steam explosion (65-73%) and ultrasound (33-57%). In fact, only applied energies higher than 220 W or temperatures higher than 80 A degrees C induced cell wall lysis in C. sorokiniana. Nonetheless, the highest methane yields were not correlated to biogas production. Thermal hydrolysis and steam explosion showed lower methane yields in respect to non-pretreated biomass, suggesting the presence of toxic compounds that inhibited the biological process. Accordingly, these pretreatment techniques led to a negative energy balance. The best pretreatment method among the ones evaluated was thermal pretreatment, with four times more energy produced that demanded.;[Cordova, Olivia| Chamy, Rolando] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ingn, Lab Biotecnol Ambiental, Escuela Ingn Bioquim, Valparaiso 2362806, Chile| [Passos, Fabiana] Fed Univ ofMinas Gerais, Dept Sanit & Environm Engn, Antonio Carlos Ave 6627, BR-31270090 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil;Cordova, O (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ingn, Lab Biotecnol Ambiental, Escuela Ingn Bioquim, Valparaiso 2362806, Chile.;olivia.cordova.v@mail.pucv.cl;Passos, Fabiana/L-1432-2016;Passos, Fabiana/0000-0001-7501-988X;Pontificie Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso| CONICYT, Beca Nacional Doctorado [21121012];The authors want to thank Pontificie Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso for the financial support.

Physicochemical characterizations of the surface-functionalized nanozeolites and nanozeolite-enzyme complexes were performed using XRD, SEM, AFM, ATR-FTIR, and zeta potential measurements. The experimental enzymatic activity results indicated that the nanozeolitic supports functionalized with APTMS and GA immobilized larger amounts of enzymes and provided higher enzymatic activities, compared to unfunctionalized supports. Correlations were observed among the nanozeolite surface charges, the enzyme immobilization efficiencies, and the biocatalyst activities. The catalytic performance and reusability of these enzyme-nanozeolite complexes were evaluated in the ethanolysis transesterification of microalgae oil to fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). TLL immobilized on the nanozeolite supports functionalized with APTMS and GA provided the most efficient biocatalysis, with FAEEs yields above 93% and stability during five reaction cycles. Lower FAEEs yields and poorer catalytic stability were found for nanozeolite-enzyme complexes prepared only by physical adsorption. The findings indicated the viability of designing highly efficient biocatalysts for biofuel production by means of chemical modulation of nanozeolite surfaces. The high biocatalyst catalytic efficiency observed in ethanolysis reactions using a lipid feedstock that does not compete with food production is an advantage that should encourage the industrial application of these biocatalysts.

In this context, the influence of CO2 supply from a synthetic gas mixture (30% v/v CO2) on the removal of pathogens (Pseudomonas, enterococci, and Escherichia colt) and total coliforms during secondary domestic wastewater treatment by a microalgal-bacterial symbiosis in a 180-L high-rate algal pond (HRAP) was investigated. The supply of CO2 in the HRAP positively influenced the Pseudomonas aeruginosa removal, with the removal efficiency increasing from 97.4% (1.6 log) to 99.6% (2.5 log) without and with CO2 supply, respectively. Likewise, the total coliform removal efficiency rose from 88.7% (1.1 log) to 99.4% (2.8 log). On the other hand, the effect of CO2 supply on enterococci (99.7% and 2.6 log) and Escherichia coli (98.6% and 2.2 log) removal was negligible.;[Ruas, Graziele| Serejo, Mayara Leite| Paulo, Paula Loureiro| Boncz, Marc Arpad] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Fac Engn Architecture & Urbanism & Geog, Ave Costa e Silva S-N, Campo Grande, Brazil;Serejo, ML (corresponding author), Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Fac Engn Architecture & Urbanism & Geog, Ave Costa e Silva S-N, Campo Grande, Brazil.;mayara.serejo@ufms.br;boncz, marc/V-3191-2019| Serejo, Mayara/G-8864-2019| Paulo, Paula/G-3194-2012;Serejo, Mayara/0000-0002-7892-2350| Paulo, Paula/0000-0002-8091-6486| Ruas, Graziele/0000-0002-0160-7985| Boncz, Marc/0000-0001-7618-8685;CNPq - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq, Brazilian National Research Council);The authors wish to thank CNPq - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq, Brazilian National Research Council) for the financial support.;;55;6;6;5;21;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0921-8971;1573-5176;;J APPL PHYCOL;J.

This work investigates the apparent metabolisable energy (AME), its nitrogen-corrected form (AMEn) and amino acid (AA) digestibility coefficients of the microalgae Spirulina platensis as an ingredient in broiler chicken diets.2. One group of birds was fed with a basal control diet (BD), and another was fed with a test diet composed of the BD with the addition of the microalgae at a proportion of 200g/kg. AME and AMEn were assessed by total excreta collection and indigestibility analysis using acid-insoluble ash (AIA) as a marker.3. The microalgae comprised 888.0g/kg dry matter (DM), 18.42MJ/kg gross energy, 514.7g/kg crude protein, 9.9g/kg ether extract, 10.6g/kg crude fibre, 94.4g/kg ash, 3.1g/kg Ca and 11.0g/kg P.4. The values obtained for AME (13.48MJ/kg DM) and AMEn (11.72MJ/kg DM) were higher (p<0.01) than those obtained using the AIA method (9.39-8.29MJ/kg DM). The microalgae ileal digestibility coefficients were 0.800.04 and 0.78 +/- 0.04 for essential and non-essential AA, respectively.5. Overall, the metabolisable energy content and digestibility of AA for S. platensis indicated that the microalgae are potentially an alternative nutrient source for broilers. The AIA method underestimated AME and AMEn in comparison to the total excreta collection method.;[Tavernari, F. De. C.| Surek, D.| Silva, M. L. B.

The ultrasound-assisted extraction was utilized for obtaining the chlorophyll compounds from biomass. A total of eleven molecules were separated in microalgae chlorophyll extract, with pheophytin a' (371 mu g.g(-1)) and chlorophyll a (1593 mu g.g(-1)) as the major ones. The chlorophyll extract was shown to be a potent scavenger of peroxyl radical, being almost 200 times more potent than a-tocopherol. These facts suggest the microalgae Phormidium autumnale as potential source of bioactive tetrapyrrole compounds. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Within this LCA, two microalgae cultivation systems were evaluated: (1) cultivation with synthetic nutrients (CSN) and (2) cultivation with cattle manure effluent from biodigestion (CME). The comparison unit among the two culture systems was the production of 10 g of dry microalgae Scenedesmus sp. biomass through the CML 2000 method. Environmental aspects and impacts of the two systems were analyzed, showing that the CME required less water and reduced the potential for eutrophication in comparison with the CSN. Furthermore, the CME reduced all physical-chemical parameters indicating efficient purification of the effluent through microalgae cultivation, resulting in a 92.5% decrease in total nitrogen and a 51.9% decrease in phosphorus. The key conclusions were that CME is an environmentally conscious and promising technology for wastewater treatment when combined with microalgae biomass production. Although the analysis was conducted in laboratory scale, it is reasonable to project the results to a larger-scale production, provided that adequate control strategies are implemented. Follow-up studies should be conducted with microalgae cultivated in similar effluents to cattle manure (e.g., pig or chicken manure, sugar cane industry effluents and wastewater) in order to evaluate their potential for biomass production and wastewater treatment applications.;[Scherer, Marisa Daniele| de Oliveira, Amanda Cristina| Mariano, Andre Bellin| Coelho Vargas, Jose Viriato] Univ Fed Parana, Ave Coronel Francisco Heraclito Santos 210, BR-81531970 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [Correa Magalhaes Filho, Fernando Jorge] Univ Catolica Dom Bosco, Ave Tamandare 6000, BR-79117900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil| [Lie Ugaya, Cassia Maria] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana, Ave Sete Setembro 3165, BR-80230901 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil;Scherer, MD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Ave Coronel Francisco Heraclito Santos 210, BR-81531970 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.;marisadanielescherer@gmail.com;Oliveira, Amanda/ABI-5947-2020| Mariano, Andre Bellin/G-7843-2012| Filho, Fernando Jorge Correa Magalhaes/M-8015-2017| Ugaya, Cassia/AAU-8890-2020| Vargas, Jose V/K-6346-2013;Mariano, Andre Bellin/0000-0002-1693-8947| Filho, Fernando Jorge Correa Magalhaes/0000-0001-5447-0137| Vargas, Jose V/0000-0002-1458-2908| Ugaya, Cassia/0000-0003-2709-0643;Brazilian National Council of Scientific and Technological Development, CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [403560/2013-6, 407198/2013-0, 407204-2013-0, 482336/2012-9, 485058/2012-0]| Peugeot-Citroen [41-2013]| NILKO Technology Ltda.|  [CAPES/CAFP-062/14];The authors acknowledge with gratitude the support of the Brazilian National Council of Scientific and Technological Development, CNPq (Projects 403560/2013-6, 407198/2013-0, 407204-2013-0, 482336/2012-9 and 485058/2012-0), projects CAPES/CAFP-062/14, Peugeot-Citroen 41-2013 and NILKO Technology Ltda.;;49;6;6;3;35;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1618-954X;1618-9558;;CLEAN TECHNOL ENVIR;Clean Technol.

Therefore, much scientific research is needed to address the issue of increasing biohydrogen production rate. For that, in this work, through a brief review of the literature and laboratory data, several genetic modification targets for microalgae hydrogen production enhancement are identified. As a result, a mathematical correlation, with dependence on the process variables, is proposed to calculate the resulting effect on H-2 production rate after genetically modifying the microalgae species. The proposed correlation gives an initial assessment on how wild and genetically modified species compare to each other, therefore providing possible means for a consistent strategy for sustainable biohydrogen supply. A simplified mathematical model is proposed for a well stirred photobioreactor based on the species conservation principle. Microalgae growth was simulated for 15 days, showing how a set of microalgae genetic modifications affects H-2 production either in combination or individually. For that, a chloroplast targeted total genetic modification parameter was defined, xi(T). The H-2 mass production efficiency, n, increasing rate is high up to xi(T) approximate to 4, showing a trend to stabilization thereafter at eta = 10 %, thus there is a value for eT, beyond which it is not worth it to increase, since the H-2 production is limited by the amount of biomass present in the medium, xi(T) approximate to 10 in the case of this study. Therefore, the model is expected to be an important and simple tool for design, control and optimization of microalgae derived hydrogen processes. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The experiments involved a bed of dry solids loaded in a cylindrical vessel with approximately 23.5 x 10(-3) kg of solvent. At the top of the cylinder there was a moving piston to allow extraction at cyclic or constant pressurization. A set of 10 kinetic extraction experiments was performed by varying the solid-liquid feed ratio at 5 levels under atmospheric pressure (91.4 kPa) and cyclic pressurization (300 s at 91.4 kPa + 300 s at 200 kPa per cycle) for 25,200 s (5(1) x 2(1) = 10). At p <= 0.1 a significant statistical effect of cyclic pressurization and solid-solvent ratio on mass fraction of extracted lipid at equilibrium (y(Ae)) was observed, while the influence of pressure at cyclic pressurization on the same response was negligible. y(Ae) was a parameter of a reliable first-order kinetic model tuned on different extraction curves involving a full set of almost 500 experimental kinetic data. Based on these equilibrium data, the highest yield and efficiency of lipid extraction were 11.3% d. b. and 72%, respectively. The slopes of tie lines in rectangular equilibrium diagrams of Ponchon-Savarit for extraction at atmospheric pressure and cyclic pressurization confirm that lipids in microalgae are not easily removed from the insoluble solid. The fraction of microalgae lipids converted to biodiesel by an esterification reaction based on the method of Hartman and Lago was approximately 89 +/- 7%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In Brazil, the National Program for use and biodiesel production has looked for the diversification of feedstock for biodiesel production. Among several alternative sources of energy, microalgae biomass shows great potential to be used as raw material for producing biodiesel. Rich in lipids and fatty acids, the oil yield per hectare in some strains of microalgae is considerably higher than the most conventional oilseed crops such as palm, Jatropha, soybean and sunflower. The commercial production triggered strong interest at the 1960s, with the development of a series of technologies to cultivate microalgae in open ponds and photobioreactors. Industrial or agricultural wastes such as vinasse previously treated in anaerobic digesters, for example, can be recycled and reused through the cultivation of microalgae, besides the application in the fertirrigation of sugar cane crop. This would also qualify the cultivation of microalgae as a clean development mechanism to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases.;[Cenciani, K.| Feigl, B. J.| Cerri, C.

Due to its cosmopolitan characteristic, its use is recommended by national and international protocols in ecotoxicity studies. The alteration of phosphatase activities by agriculture pollutants like heavy metals has been extensively used as a biomarker in risk assessment and biomonitoring. In this study, we compared the extraction of acid phosphatase from P. subcapitata by different procedures and we studied the stability, substrates specificity, kinetics and the effect of Hg2+ in the crude extract. The freezing and thawing technique associated with probe sonication was the most suitable method of extraction. The enzyme was stable when frozen at -20 degrees C for at least six months, showed an optimum pH of 5 and a Km value of 0.27 mM for p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) as substrate. Some natural organic substrates were cleaved by a similar extent as the synthetic substrate pNPP. Short term exposure (24 hours) to Hg2+ had little effect but inhibition of the specific activity was observed after 7 days with EC50 (concentration of Hg2+ that promotes 50% decrease of specific activity) value of 12.63 mu M Hg2+.;[Jonsson, Claudio Martin] Embrapa Meio Ambiente, Lab Ecotoxicol & Biosseguranca, BR-13820000 Jaguariuna, SP, Brazil| [Aoyama, Hiroshi] UNICAMP IB, Depto Bioquim, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil;Jonsson, CM (corresponding author), Embrapa Meio Ambiente, Lab Ecotoxicol & Biosseguranca, CP 69, BR-13820000 Jaguariuna, SP, Brazil.;jonsson@cnpma.embrapa.br;Jonsson, Claudio/I-8387-2012;;Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA);This work was supported by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) and Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA).

However, few studies report data concerning biomass productivity in continuous reactors using unsterilized wastewater effluents. This study focuses on indigenous microalgae strains that grow with native bacteria and are applicable for biomass production and tertiary wastewater treatment in continuous growth mode. Initially, five Chlorophyta strains were isolated and grown in batch mode to single out a potential inoculum for the experiments in continuous growth mode. The isolate Chlorella sp. L06 was selected and evaluated based on five dilution rates from 0.1 to 0.5 day(-1) on continuous growth reactor using unsterilized secondary effluent as culture medium. Maximal volumetric biomass productivity of 283 mg L-1 day(-1) was achieved at 0.3 day(-1) without CO2 addition or air bubbling. Carbohydrates were the major fraction of the dried biomass, followed by proteins and then lipids. The highest removal rates of total nitrogen and phosphorus from the liquid phase were 13.0 and 1.4 mg L-1 day(-1), respectively, and were obtained at 0.4 day(-1). The maximal decay rate for E. coli (2.9 day(-1)) was achieved both at 0.3 and 0.4 day(-1). Conclusively, Chlorella sp. L06 cultivation in unsterilized secondary effluent can be adjusted depending on the objective: for biomass production, a dilution rate of approximately 0.3 day(-1) is recommended| and for tertiary treatment a rate of 0.4 day(-1) is suggested.;[Pereira, Marcos Vinicius| Dassoler, Aline Figueredo| Antunes, Paulo Wagnner| Goncalves, Ricardo Franci| Cassini, Servio Tulio] Univ Fed Espirito Santo UFES, Dept Engn Ambiental, Ave Fernando Ferrari 514, BR-29075910 Vitoria, ES, Brazil;Cassini, ST (corresponding author), Univ Fed Espirito Santo UFES, Dept Engn Ambiental, Ave Fernando Ferrari 514, BR-29075910 Vitoria, ES, Brazil.;cassinist@gmail.com;Perez-Fuentes, Maria del Carmen/C-3018-2011| CASSINI, SERVIO/C-8043-2014;Perez-Fuentes, Maria del Carmen/0000-0001-5950-5175| Dassoler, Aline/0000-0002-7656-9370| Pereira, Marcos Vinicius/0000-0002-9634-1250| CASSINI, SERVIO/0000-0001-5200-3666;FAPES Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Espirito Santo [156-2018]| FINEP Fiancidadora de Estudos e Projetos [01.13.0092-00]| CAPES Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel SuperiorCAPES;This work was supported by FAPES Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Espirito Santo, [grant 156-2018] and FINEP Fiancidadora de Estudos e Projetos [grant 01.13.0092-00].

The research was conducted at the wastewater treatment plant of the University of Santa Cruz do Sul, (UNISC), from october 2018 to april 2019. An integrated system with, anaerobic reactor (AR), microalgae (MA) and constructed wetlands (CWs) was, proposed for detoxification of the wastewaters produced at the university campus with a hydraulic detention time of 17 days. Daphnia, magna (ecotoxicity) and Allium cepa (phytotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and, genotoxicity) were used as tools to monitor the efficiency of the integrated system. Obtained results showed that the integrated system (MA, CWs) presented good COD and BOD5 reductions, besides removal rates of, almost 98% for N-NH3, being much more efficient than the UNISC wastewater, treatment plant (UWITP). The results of ecotoxicity presented the raw wastewaters (RW) as slightly toxic and an absence of ecotoxicity in all the treatments steps. Regarding phytotoxicity, the results showed no significant differences between the treatments. The cytogenetic assays indicated a significant increase in mitotic index (MI) (p < 0.001) after treatment by CWs compared to the final treatment UW1TP while the results, regarding binucleated cells (BNC) did not present significant differences, among the treatments. Micronucleus (MN) indexes were significantly different between the UWWPT and the integrated system (p < 0.01). In relation to chromosome aberrations (CA) the results indicate a significant difference between the CWs and UWWTP treatments (p < 0.01) and, RW and CWs (p < 0.001), confirming the detoxifying potential of the integrated system when compared to UWW17. Thus, the results of the present research highlight the relevance in the proposition of the integrated system as an alternative of deaner technology to the detriment of conventional technologies applied in wastewater treatment.

Serum and tissues (heart, liver, kidneys, and spleen) were analyzed. The microalgae biomass presented a valuable content of biocompounds. In serum, the T2 treatment promoted an increase in high-density lipoprotein but also triglycerides levels. The T1 increased glutathione peroxidase (kidney) and antioxidant potential of all tissues, while T2 treatment was able to raise the glutathione reductase (liver) and glutathione peroxidase (kidneys) activities, as well as the heart antioxidant potential. The two doses reduced lipid peroxidation in all tissues.

Flotation processes are influenced by the physical characteristics of bubbles and particles, and therefore it is necessary to investigate the size distribution of generated bubbles, their action in microalgal cells and the oxidation and release of proteins that act as biosurfactants. In this work the effect of ozone bubble size in a three-phase system (ozone - wastewater - micro algae) and size of microalgal particles separated by ozone - flotation were evaluated. Three ozone flows were used (0.2, 0.6 and 1 L/min). Best results were obtained with a flow of 0.6 L/min achieving 88.5% efficiency, increased biomass oxidation, destabilization of microalgal cells (zeta potential 3.17 mV), highest protein release (46.7 mg/L) and, a demonstrated efficiency of proteins in reducing bubble coalescence. Regarding the latter, no differences in size or distribution of the ozone bubbles were obtained between the 3 evaluated heights of the column (bottom, middle and top). At this flow the mean bubble diameters were maintained at 1910, 2028 and 2071 mu m for bottom, middle and top, respectively, with approximately 50% of the bubbles concentrated up to 2000 mu m. In addition, due to the higher action of ozone with microalgal cells, smaller particle sizes in the column were found due to the oxidizing action of ozone.;[Oliveira, Gislayne Alves| Carissimi, Elvis] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Pos Grad Engn Civil, Ctr Tecnol, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil| [Monje-Ramirez, Ignacio| Chavez Mejia, Alma Concepcion| Orta Ledesma, Maria Teresa] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Coordinat Ingn Ambiental, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico| [Rodrigues, Rafael Teixeira] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Engn Minas, Av Bento Goncalves, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil| [Velasquez-Orta, Sharon B.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Adv Mat, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England;Ledesma, MTO (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ingn, Coordinat Ingn Ambiental, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.;tol@pumas.iingen.unam.mx;Rodrigues, Rafael Teixeira/X-8692-2019| Carissimi, Elvis/AAV-2200-2020;Rodrigues, Rafael Teixeira/0000-0003-1223-0738| Carissimi, Elvis/0000-0001-5964-7915| Alves Oliveira, Gislayne/0000-0001-5407-9496| Monje-Ramirez, Ignacio/0000-0002-8910-2235;Fondo Sectorial de Sustentabilidad Energetica CONACYT-SENER [220704];The authors acknowledge MSc.

Simulation tools were used to study a sugarcane biorefinery producing ethanol from sugarcane juice (1G) and bagasse (2G)| the microalgal growth in an open pond| and the processing of microalgal biomass into lipids, proteins and synthetic natural gas (SNG). Supercritical water gasification (SONG) of microalgal biomass enables an increase in biofuel production of 10.2% MJ when no extraction process is considered and of 1.9% MJ when LPSE is considered. The heat demand of the proposed biorefinery with LPSE was increased by 87.8% compared with the demand of the sugarcane biorefinery without microalgal growth and processing. When the SFE process is considered, the heat demand of the overall process increased 3.2 times. SFE for wet microalgae processing is not economically attractive, as it increases the total investment by 71%. The CO2 flow used in the SFE process demonstrated to be a key factor in the thermoeconomic viability of the process. Regarding the wet processing of microalgae prior to SCWG, the best alternative studied was the use of LPSE technology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, ecotoxicological tests usually consider only the photoautotrophic metabolism. This research investigated the ecotoxicological differences between photoautotrophy and mixotrophy in Chlorella sorokiniana exposed to cadmium (Cd). Chlorophyll a, photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), cell viability, biochemical composition and pH were used to monitor possible toxic effects at 72 h cultures. Glucose (1 g.L-1) was used as organic carbon source. To evaluate the probability of the photoautotrophic culture being more affected by Cc than the mixotrophic one, Bayesian statistical analysis was performed. The photoautotrophic cultures were more affected by Cd than the mixotrophic ones, with reduction of all evaluated parameters, excep for protein concentration. However, in mixotrophic cultures, no changes in protein concentration and proteins:carbohydrates ratio were observed, and chlorophyll a, Fv/Fm and cell viability were only affected at the high Cd concentrations (range In -11.5 to -9.4). However, both mixotrophy and photoautotrophy had the same probability of having the carbohydrates concentration affected by Cd. We conclude that the microalgae in mixotrophy were more resistant to the Cd than in photoautotrophy. In addition, we showed that under photoautotrophy Fv/Fm decreased linearly as Cd concentration increased, but in mixotrophy no effect was observed up to 10-5 molL(-1) Cd, after which it decreased. We rationale that the reduced photosynthetic capacity under mixotrophy can end up reducing the release of oxygen gas, which can compromise the entire aquatic ecosystem. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Both approaches have disadvantages, due to the high cost of cultivating microalgae with sufficient lipid content (>40%), while the whole cell conversion produces low quality oils, which require significant further upgrading. This work investigated the possibility of realising the benefits of both processes, by studying the liquefaction reaction of a lipid-extracted algae hydrolysate.MethodsIn order to enhance oil yields, the reaction was conducted in the presence of varying loadings of iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) and applied two waste steel furnace residues as potential liquefaction catalysts.ResultsPrimarily, The lipid extraction process needs to be optimized to reduce the amount of acid contaminant within the liquefaction medium. For the HTL process, the addition of 50vol% IPA resulted in remarkably high oil yields of up to 60.2wt% on an organic basis, whereas the two furnace residues had no positive effect on the product distribution, and instead favoured the formation of solid reaction products. Nevertheless, the results suggested that the presence of iron potentially reduced the nitrogen and oxygen content of the bio-oil.ConclusionsAs such, HTL is a suitable method for valorising lipid-extracted algal biomass, where the bio-oil yields can be enhanced substantially by using IPA in conjunction with the water.;[Wagner, Jonathan L.] Univ Bath, Dept Chem Engn, Ctr Doctoral Training Sustainable Chem Technol, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England| [Perin, Julio| Franco, Telma Teixeira] Univ Estadual Campinas, NIPE, Cidade Univ Zeferino Vaz,Cora Coralina 330, BR-13083896 Campinas, SP, Brazil| [Coelho, Renato Sano| Franco, Telma Teixeira] Univ Estadual Campinas, Fac Engn Quim, Cidade Univ Zeferino Vaz,Ave Albert Einstein 500, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil| [Ting, Valeska P.] Univ Bristol, Dept Mech Engn, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England| [Chuck, Christopher J.] Univ Bath, Dept Chem Engn, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England;Franco, TT (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, NIPE, Cidade Univ Zeferino Vaz,Cora Coralina 330, BR-13083896 Campinas, SP, Brazil.| Franco, TT (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Fac Engn Quim, Cidade Univ Zeferino Vaz,Ave Albert Einstein 500, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil.| Chuck, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Chem Engn, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.;c.chuck@bath.ac.uk| franco@feq.unicamp.br;Franco, Telma Teixeira/A-2397-2013| Coelho, Renato Sano/N-1280-2014| Ting, Valeska/C-8665-2011;Franco, Telma Teixeira/0000-0002-9611-4541| Coelho, Renato Sano/0000-0001-5141-3399| Ting, Valeska/0000-0003-3049-0939;Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/G03768X/1]| University of Bath Global Research Scholarship Scheme;The authors would like to ackonwledge Prof. Ulf Schuchardt for all his input and guidance at the start of the project.

LEB 18 for potential application in food packaging field. With the highest protein concentration, the mean diameter of nanofibers was approximately 450 nm. For nanofibers developed with 5% (w.w(-1)) of protein concentrate, the peaks in FTIR spectra were observed at 1641 cm(-1) (amide I) and 1533 cm(-1) (amide II). Moreover, the increasing of protein concentration of 5-10% (w.w(-1)) enhanced the initial temperature of degradation of the nanofibers at 34 degrees C, when the poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) was added after solution heating. The possibility of formation of uniforms nanofibers using the acidic solution with a low concentration of PEO (0.8%, w.w(-1)) shows the potential of the protein concentrate from Spirulina sp.

The aim of this research was to investigate biological hydrogen production by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CC425) and Chlamydomonas moewusii (SAG 24.91) by direct biophotolysis in batch cultures. Strains were cultivated in TAP growth medium (pH 7.2) in two phases: in the first stage, cultures were maintained in an aerobic condition until the middle of the exponential phase| in the second stage, the biomass was transferred to closed anaerobic photobioreactors under sulfur deprived. Gas chromatography and Gompertz model were used to measure the hydrogen production and hydrogen production rate, respectively. We noticed that maximum hydrogen production by biomass of C. reinhardtii was 5.95 +/- 0.88 mu mol mg(-1) and the productivity was 17.02 +/- 3.83 mu mol L-1 h(-1), with hydrogen production five times higher than C. moewusii, approximately, though, C. moewusii obtained a higher ethanol yield compared to C. reinhardtii. The hydrogen production method, with the cultivation of strains in two different phases and sulfur deprivation, was effective for obtaining of biohydrogen for Chlamydomonas| however, it depends on the species, strain and growth conditions.;[Vargas, Sarah Regina| dos Santos, Paulo Vagner| Giraldi, Lais Albuquerque| Calijuri, Maria do Carmo] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Hydraul & Sanitat, Escola Engn Sao Carlos, Av Trabalhador Sao Carlense 400, BR-13566590 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| [Zaiat, Marcelo] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Hydraul & Sanitat, Escola Engn Sao Carlos, Av Joao Dagnone 1100, BR-13563120 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil;Vargas, SR (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Hydraul & Sanitat, Escola Engn Sao Carlos, Av Trabalhador Sao Carlense 400, BR-13566590 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;sarahvargas@alumni.usp.br;Zaiat, Marcelo/C-4752-2012| Calijuri, Maria do Carmo/I-6602-2013;Zaiat, Marcelo/0000-0001-7336-9093| Calijuri, Maria do Carmo/0000-0003-1237-8783| Regina Vargas, Sarah/0000-0003-0922-0678;National Council for Scientific and Technological DevelopmentNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq);This work was supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development.;;28;5;5;1;16;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0378-1097;1574-6968;;FEMS MICROBIOL LETT;FEMS Microbiol.

Suspended microalgae samples were treated for 60 minutes under different cavitation intensities (cavitation number-Cv-ranging from 0.17 to 0.27). Results evidenced that microalgae decay over time can be modeled through first-order kinetics. The maximum removal efficiency (85%) was recorded at the highest cavitation intensity (Cv = 0.17). The removal efficiency decreased as the cavitation number increased. Hydrodynamic cavitation was effective in inactivating Scenedesmus| it produced irreversible damages to cell morphology such as flotation spines removal, cell wall lesions, cytoplasm extravasation, and cavity formation. Assumingly, hydrodynamic cavitation has great potential to treat eutrophic water bodies. Furthermore, it represents a sustainable removal technique, since it does not produce secondary pollution.;[Batista, Marylia Duarte| Borella Marfil Anhe, Ana Carolina| de Souza Inacio Goncalves, Julio Cesar] Univ Fed Triangulo Mineiro, Dept Environm Engn, Av Dr Randolfo Borges Jr 1250, BR-38064200 Uberaba, MG, Brazil;Goncalves, JCDI (corresponding author), Univ Fed Triangulo Mineiro, Dept Environm Engn, Av Dr Randolfo Borges Jr 1250, BR-38064200 Uberaba, MG, Brazil.;maryliadb@hotmail.com| anacbanhe@yahoo.com.br| sigjulio@gmail.com;;;;;;29;5;6;1;18;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0049-6979;1573-2932;;WATER AIR SOIL POLL;Water Air Soil Pollut.;NOV 11;2017;228;11;;;;;;;443;10.1007/s11270-017-3624-x;;;8;Environmental Sciences| Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences| Water Resources;Environmental Sciences & Ecology| Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences| Water Resources;FN4EZ;WOS:000415958400003;;;;;2021-01-01

However, many uncertainties exist regarding the environmental implications of engineered nanomaterials. This study examined the effect of the MWCNTs on metabolic status and morphology of filamentous green microalgae Klebsormidium flaccidum. Appropriate concentrations of MWCNT (1, 50, and 100 mu g mL(-1)) were added to a microalgal culture in the exponential growth phase and incubated for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Exposure to MWCNT led to reductions in algal growth after 48 h and decreased on cell viability for all experimental endpoints except for 1 A mu g mL(-1) at 24 h and 100 A mu g mL(-1) after 72 h. At 100 A mu g mL(-1), MWCNTs induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and had an effect on intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content depending on concentration and time. No photosynthetic activity variation was observed. Observations by scanning transmission electron microscopy showed cell damage. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that exposure to MWCNTs affects cell metabolism and microalgal cell morphology. To our best knowledge, this is the first case in which MWCNTs exhibit adverse effects on filamentous green microalgae K. flaccidum. These results contribute to elucidate the mechanism of MWCNT nanotoxicity in the bioindicator organism of terrestrial and freshwater habitats.;[Munk, Michele] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Dept Biol, Campus Univ, BR-36036900 Juiz De Fora, Brazil| [Brandao, Humberto M.] Brazilian Agr Res Corp EMBRAPA, Lab Nanotechnol, BR-36038330 Juiz De Fora, Brazil| [Yepremian, Claude| Coute, Alain] Natl Museum Nat Hist, Commun Mol & Adaptat Microorganisms, UMR 7245, Paris, France| [Ladeira, Luiz O.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Phys, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil| [Raposo, Nadia R.

The effects of different concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) on PL performance were also evaluated. One experimental group was reared in a conventional microalgae-based system with daily water exchange and daily addition of microalgae (herein called microalgae treatment). The other two experimental groups were reared using biofloc technology (BFT) with daily dextrose addition and no water exchange, but in the Biofloc-500 treatment, TSS were maintained at around 500 mg L-1, while in the Biofloc-700 treatment, TSS were maintained at around 700 mg L-1. Water quality variables remained within the appropriate range for larval culture. In microalgae treatment, ammonia control was likely associated with its assimilation into microalgae biomass and daily water exchange. In biofloc tanks, however, the addition of dextrose stimulated the production of bacterial biomass from ammonia. This system required only 12.9% of the water used by the microalgae treatment since water was not exchanged during the culture. The nursery of young PLs resulted in similar (P > 0.05) performance in all treatments: survival > 94%, PL length -11.5 mm, and PL dry weight -1.2 mg. In addition, the salinity stress test (> 90.0%) was not significantly different among treatments. Our results indicate that BFT can be as effective as the microalgae-based system for the nursery of young L. vannamei post -larvae. We also found that post -larvae performance was similar (P > 0.05) between biofloc treatments, indicating that organisms can tolerate environments with large quantities of solids.;[Schveitzer, Rodrigo] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Marine Sci, Santos, SP, Brazil| [de Lorenzo, Marco Antonio| Vieira, Felipe do Nascimento| Pereira, Scheila Anelise| Mourino, Jose Luiz Pedreira| Seiffert, Walter Quadros| Andreatta, Edemar Roberto] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Aquaculture, Marine Shrimp Lab, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil;Schveitzer, R (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Paulo UNIFESP, Dept Ciencias Mar, Edificio Acad 2,Rua Dr Carvalho de Mendonca 144, BR-11070100 Santos, SP, Brazil.;rschveitzer@hotmail.com;Schveitzer, Rodrigo/D-9199-2013| Mourino, Jose Luiz Pedreira/AAG-7527-2019| Mourino, Jose Luiz Pedreira/AAG-7517-2019| Pereira, Scheila/X-4649-2019;Schveitzer, Rodrigo/0000-0002-5660-3930| Mourino, Jose Luiz Pedreira/0000-0002-8619-0882| Pereira, Scheila/0000-0002-0936-7250| Andreatta, Edemar Roberto/0000-0003-2728-7921;CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [151032/2012-2, PQ 309868/2014-9, 302792/2012-0];The authors would like to thank CNPq for the postdoctoral grant awarded to Rodrigo Schveitzer (Process 151032/2012-2) and research fellowships for Felipe Vieira and Walter Seiffert (process numbers PQ 309868/2014-9 and 302792/2012-0, respectively).

As a result, the use of biomass as an energy source is one of the most promising methods in the reduction of energy dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels. In order to reduce the amount of solvent used during direct transesterification, this study has aimed at producing biodiesel from microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) biomass using enzymatic catalysis (Novozym 435) and pressurized fluid (propane). The effects of pressure (3000 to 8000 kPa), temperature (323.15 to 353.15K), and exposure time (1 to 8h) have been studied through the experimental design for esters conversion. The newly investigated system showed consistency through the experimental design technique, evaluating the effect of significant variables such as time, temperature, and pressure in the process. The good conversions yielded have been achieved using mild temperature and higher pressure conditions, demonstrating that this process has great potential for obtaining biodiesel from microalgae biomass.;[Marcon, Naiane Sabedot| Colet, Rosicler| Steffens, Clarice] URI Erechim, Dept Food Engn, Av Sete Setembro 1621, BR-99700000 Erechim, RS, Brazil| [Balen, Darline Simoni| Bender, Joao Paulo| Dalla Rosa, Clarissa] Southern Frontier Fed Univ, Erechim Campus,Av Dom Joao Hoffmann 313, BR-99700000 Erechim, RS, Brazil| [Pereira de Pereira, Claudio Martin] Univ Fed Pelotas, R Gen Osorio 725, BR-96020000 Pelotas, RS, Brazil| [Bibilio, Denise| Priamo, Wagner] IFRS, Dept Food Technol, Sertao Campus, BR-99170000 Sertao, RS, Brazil;Steffens, C (corresponding author), URI Erechim, Dept Food Engn, Av Sete Setembro 1621, BR-99700000 Erechim, RS, Brazil.;claristeffens@yahoo.com.br;Priamo, Wagner Luiz/J-7531-2013| Steffens, Clarice/I-3811-2013| de Pereira, Claudio Pereira/T-7512-2019| Priamo, Wagner/X-2735-2019;Priamo, Wagner Luiz/0000-0001-9983-9583| Steffens, Clarice/0000-0003-4394-125X| de Pereira, Claudio Pereira/0000-0002-2818-4281| Priamo, Wagner/0000-0001-9983-9583;FapergsFoundation for Research Support of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)| URI Erechim| UFFS| CapesCAPES;The authors would like to thank Fapergs, URI Erechim, UFFS, and Capes for their financial support and IFRS for chromatograph analyses.;;26;5;5;2;6;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0008-4034;1939-019X;;CAN J CHEM ENG;Can.

The experimental data, obtained from a bench-scale facility, were used to estimate the costs of an industrial scale (16,000 m(3)/d). The results indicate removal efficiencies of 97.6%, 85.5% and 92.4% for COD, N-TKN and P-PO4-3, respectively, in parallel to a microalgal sludge productivity of 0.27 kg/m(3)/d. The economic analysis demonstrated a cost of USD 2.66/m(3) of treated industrial wastewater, and as consequence of this process, the production cost of microalgal sludge was USD 0.03/kg of dehydrated biomass.;[dos Santos, Alberto Meireles| Roso, Gabriela Rigo| de Menezes, Cristiano Ragagnin| Zepka, Leila Queiroz| Jacob-Lopes, Eduardo] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Roraima Ave 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil| [Queiroz, Maria Isabel] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Sch Chem & Food, Italia Ave, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil;Jacob-Lopes, E (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Roraima Ave 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.;albertomsrs@gmail.com| grossorigo@gmail.com| cristianoragagnin@yahoo.com.br| queirozmariaisabel@gmail.com| lqz@pq.cnpq.br| jacoblopes@pq.cnpq.br;MENEZES, CRISTIANO/T-5665-2019;;Brasil Foods Inc.;This research was supported by Brasil Foods Inc.

Two treatments in three replicates were tested over a 15-day period: with and without the addition of the microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata at a concentration of 2.02 perpendicular to 0.44 x 10(-6) cells mL(-1). At each replicate, beginning on the second day of life, 120 H. reidi juveniles (stocking density of 3 ind L-1) were fed the offspring of the benthic copepod Tisbe biminiensis (100 copepod cm(-2)) together with newly hatched Artemia nauplii (3.8 mL(-1)). From the sixth day of life, enriched Artemia metanauplii replaced newly hatched Artemia nauplii. After 15 days, the H. reidi individuals were counted, measured and weighed. Mean survival was significantly greater in the microalgae treatment (76.42 +/- 5.07%) than in the treatment with no microalgae (25.44 +/- 6.91%). Moreover, total length, height and dry weight were significantly larger in the microalgae treatment. Thus, the addition of microalgae increases the growth and survival of H. reidi juveniles fed T. biminiensis and Artemia. The higher growth and survival of H. reidi juveniles was not related to the larger ingestion rates but probably to the nutritional improvement of the live feeds or to the probiotic effect. The protocol developed for rearing H. reidi juveniles resulted in a high survival, and represents an advance in the farming of this species.;[Silfronio Melo, Roberta Cecilia| Morais Brito, Ana Paula| Gouveia, Adriana de Andrade| Marcal, Clebson| Cavalli, Ronaldo Olivera] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco UFRPE, Lab Piscicultura Marinha, Dept Pesca & Aquicultura, Recife, PE, Brazil| [de Souza Santos, Lilia Pereira] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco UFRPE, Lab Cult & Ecotoxicol, Dept Oceanog, Ave Arquitetura S-N, Recife, PE, Brazil;Santos, LPD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco UFRPE, Lab Cult & Ecotoxicol, Dept Oceanog, Ave Arquitetura S-N, Recife, PE, Brazil.;liliapssantos@gmail.com;Cavalli, Ronaldo O/F-7461-2012| SOUZA-SANTOS, LILIA P/I-1653-2012| Melo, Roberta/AAT-8315-2020;Souza-Santos, Lilia/0000-0002-0187-5840| Cavalli, Ronaldo/0000-0003-3390-6346;Brazilian Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture (MPA)| National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [559.658/2009-5]| Foundation for Science and Technology of the State of Pernambuco (FACEPE);The authors are grateful to the Brazilian Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture (MPA) and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for financial support within the scope of the sub-network 'Production systems of the seahorse H. reidi (Syngnathidae)' (Proc. 559.658/2009-5)| to the Foundation for Science and Technology of the State of Pernambuco (FACEPE) for study grants to R.

Additionally, attenuation of the toxicity of pyrimethanil due to its dissipation in the water was assessed. Pyrimethanil-contaminated samples were taken from outdoor mesocosms one (1.4 mg L-1 of pyrimethanil) and ten (0.78 mg L-1 of pyrimethanil) days after pyrimethanil application. Different dilutions were prepared using both nutrient-rich culture medium (LC Oligo) and non-contaminated mesocosm samples, and cell growth inhibition was assessed. Reference mesocosm samples were also diluted with LC Oligo in order to verify how the nutrient concentration in the LC Oligo could improve cell growth. Comparing cell growth of population exposed to pyrimethanil-treated sample taken at day 1 with cells growing in reference sample and LC Oligo, the growth inhibition was 80% (+/-6.5) and 95% (+/-2.0), respectively. The toxicity of samples taken from contaminated mesocosms at day 10 was attenuated to 34% (+/-15) (when compared with reference sample) and 88% (+/-3.0) (when compared with LC Oligo), as pyrimethanil concentrations in the mesocosms decreased. In conclusion, (i) pyrimethanil can be an environmental disturber for the microalgae| (ii) the toxicity of pyrimethanil in water was reduced almost 2.4 times (when compared with the reference sample) at as short a period as 10 d if assuming that pesticide entrance is not continuous| (iii) toxicity of an environmental sample could be underestimated if the sample/medium used in dilution presents different nutrient levels.

Numerous studies have addressed the benefits of ASTA for human health, including the inhibition of LDL oxidation, UV-photoprotection and prophylaxis of bacterial stomach ulcers. ASTA is recognized as a powerful scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially those involved in lipid peroxidation. Both aerobic and anaerobic exercise are closely related to overproduction of ROS in muscle tissue. Post-exercise inflammatory processes can even exacerbate the oxidative stress imposed by exercise. Thus, ASTA is suggested here as a putative nutritional alternative/coadjutant for antioxidant therapy to afford additional protection to muscle tissues against oxidative damage induced by exercise, as well as for an (overall) integrative redox re-balance and general human health.;[Barros, Marcelo P.| Poppe, Sandra C.] Univ Cruzeiro Sul, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Movimento Humano, Inst Ciencias Atividade Fis & Esporte, BR-01506000 Sao Paulo, Brazil| [Souza-Junior, Tacito P.] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Educ Fis, Setor Ciencias Biol, BR-80060000 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil;Barros, MP (corresponding author), Univ Cruzeiro Sul, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Movimento Humano, Inst Ciencias Atividade Fis & Esporte, BR-01506000 Sao Paulo, Brazil.;marcelo.barros@cruzeirodosul.edu.br;Barros, Marcelo P/K-1410-2013| Barros, Marcelo/ABD-1731-2020;Barros, Marcelo P/0000-0003-3565-8331| Barros, Marcelo/0000-0003-3565-8331;Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP, Brazil)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2002/09405-9, 2009/12342-8]| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, BrazilCAPES| International Foundation for Science (IFS, Sweden)International Foundation for Science [F/3618-1]| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (Bolsa Produtividade em Pesquisa, CNPq, Brazil)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [312404/2009-3];The authors are indebted to the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (Projects n. 2002/09405-9 and 2009/12342-8, FAPESP, Brazil), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Brazil, International Foundation for Science (Project F/3618-1, IFS, Sweden) and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (Bolsa Produtividade em Pesquisa, Nivel 2, n. 312404/2009-3, CNPq, Brazil,) for research funding and financial support.;;58;5;6;0;22;SOC BRASILEIRA FARMACOGNOSIA;JOAO PESSOA;C/O PROF JOSE MARIA BARBOSA FILHO, UNIV FEDERAL PARAIBA, LAB TECNOLOGIA  FARMACEUTICA, JOAO PESSOA, 58051-970PB, BRAZIL;0102-695X;;;REV BRAS FARMACOGN;Rev.

Male mice were divided into control groups and supplemented with different doses of microalgae carotenoids: 0.25 (MC1) and 2.5 (MC2) mg.kg(-1) bodyweight. The lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, low and high-density lipoprotein) and markers of hepatic toxicity were determined in serum samples. Antioxidant enzymes and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were determined in the heart, liver, kidneys, and spleen. Both doses used to treat the animals did not show adverse effects by markers of hepatic toxicity. MC1 did not cause significant changes in the serum lipid profile. In contrast, it created a significant reduction in lipid peroxidation of the spleen (46%) as well as an increase in the GR in the heart (40%) and GPx in the kidneys (79%) activity. The MC2 treatment also increased GR (49%) in the heart and GPx (243%) in the heart and kidneys (58%) activity, however, significantly increased levels of lipid peroxidation in the liver (160%) as well as serum triglycerides (60%). According to results, it is suggested that the consumption of S. obliquus carotenoids at the MC1 dose was safe to the animals and could be explored as an alternative to improve the activity of antioxidant enzymes and reduce lipid peroxidation.;[do Nascimento, Tatiele Casagrande| Jacob-Lopes, Eduardo| Zepka, Leila Queiroz] Fed Univ Santa Maria UFSM, Dept Food Technol & Sci, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil| [Betim Cazarin, Cinthia Bau| Marostica, Mario Roberto, Jr.] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Sch Food Engn, Dept Dept Food & Nutr, BR-13083862 Campinas, SP, Brazil| [Mercadante, Adriana Zerlotti] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Dept Food Sci, BR-13083862 Campinas, SP, Brazil;Zepka, LQ (corresponding author), Fed Univ Santa Maria UFSM, Dept Food Technol & Sci, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.;zepkaleila@yahoo.com.br;Cazarin, Cinthia BB/I-8837-2014;Cazarin, Cinthia BB/0000-0002-9849-2546;MCTI/CNPq/MEC/CAPES/PROCAD (Brazil) [312564/2015-5]| PNPD/CAPESCAPES [001]| CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [301108/2016-1];This study was financially supported by the MCTI/CNPq/MEC/CAPES/PROCAD (Brazil) (312564/2015-5), PNPD/CAPES (001) and CNPq (301108/2016-1).;;55;4;4;4;8;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0963-9969;1873-7145;;FOOD RES INT;Food Res.

Among these harvesting techniques, flotation stands out as a promising method, however it is still minimally explored when compared to the sedimentation method. In this study, the pH modulation followed by dissolved air flotation (DAF) was tested as a harvesting method for Chlorella sorokiniana cultivated in wastewater. The main aims of this study were to optimize the operational parameters of coagulation (pH, velocity gradient, and mixing time) and flotation (recirculation rate), check their reproducibility and resilience with the variability of wastewater characteristics, and evaluate the final wastewater quality after treatment using an optimized harvesting method. Parameter optimization was carried out using the one-factor-at-a-time method. The optimal parameters were a velocity gradient of 500 s(-1), mixing time of 30 s, pH 12, and 20% of recirculation rate. High efficiencies were obtained for C. sorokiniana removal (96.5-97.9%), making it a successful process. Moreover, the photobioreactor effluent quality was also improved significantly after microalgae harvesting, with high nutrient removal (88.6-95.1% of total Kjeldahl nitrogen and 91.8-98.3% of total phosphorus) and organic matter removal (80.5-86.8% of chemical oxygen demand). The results showed the pH modulation and DAF as an effective process for wastewater treatment and biomass harvesting. This study also indicated the importance of operational optimization, not studied until now, in which the achieved results could be potentially applied as practical guidelines for microalgae harvesting on a large scale.;[Leite, Luan de Souza| dos Santos, Priscila Ribeiro| Daniel, Luiz Antonio] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Hydraul & Sanitat, Sao Carlos Sch Engn, Av Trabalhador Sao Carlense 400, BR-1356659 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil;Leite, LD (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Hydraul & Sanitat, Sao Carlos Sch Engn, Av Trabalhador Sao Carlense 400, BR-1356659 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;luanleite@usp.br;de Souza Leite, Luan/AAE-1225-2019| Daniel, Luiz A/E-7736-2013;de Souza Leite, Luan/0000-0002-2108-2960| Daniel, Luiz A/0000-0002-1765-4209;Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/50351-4, 2017/14620-1];This work was supported by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) for research assistance [Proc. 2013/50351-4] and Master's Grant [Proc. 2017/14620-1].

In this study, a combination of different harvesting and drying methods for Scenedesmus obliquus was proposed. S. obliquus was cultivated in a pond raceway for 15 days until reaching stationary phase. The culture was separated by different harvesting methods (centrifugation and flocculation) and drying methods (freezing, freeze-drying and oven drying), each combination in triplicate. Flocculation did not influence FAME yield of S. obliquus, except when the biomass was dried in an oven. The biomass that was only frozen had the lowest FAME content due to the presence of reactive water in the biomass. In contrast, frozen biomass had higher content of saturated and monosaturated fatty acids| freeze-drying or oven drying caused an enrichment of the polyunsaturated fatty acids content. In conclusion, if the biomass will be used to extract polyunsaturated fatty acids, freeze-drying would be more appropriate. On the other hand, if the purpose of the biomass is to produce biodiesel, the best process would be to just freeze the biomass.;[Barbosa de Oliveira, Carlos Yure| Viegas, Thayna Lye| Lopes, Rafael Garcia| Cella, Herculano| Derner, Roberto Bianchini] Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Aquaculture Dept, Lab Algae Cultivat, BR-88061600 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [Menezes, Rafael Silva| Soares, Aline Terra| Antoniosi Filho, Nelson Roberto] Fed Univ Goias UFG, Chem Inst, Lab Extract & Separat Methods, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil;de Oliveira, CYB (corresponding author), Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Aquaculture Dept, Lab Algae Cultivat, BR-88061600 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;yureboliveira@gmail.com;Derner, Roberto Bianchini/F-1766-2015| de Oliveira, Carlos Yure Barbosa/V-1726-2019| Filho, Nelson Roberto Antoniosi/R-8297-2019;Derner, Roberto Bianchini/0000-0001-6474-1287| de Oliveira, Carlos Yure Barbosa/0000-0001-9237-1869| Filho, Nelson Roberto Antoniosi/0000-0002-3067-0385;Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) by FINEP [01.10.0457.00]| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [574796/2008-8]| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior BrazilCAPES [001];The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) for financial support provided by FINEP (Agreement No. 01.10.0457.00), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (Case No. 574796/2008-8), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior Brazil (Finance Code 001).;;33;4;4;2;3;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0961-9534;1873-2909;;BIOMASS BIOENERG;Biomass Bioenerg.;JAN;2020;132;;;;;;;;105437;10.1016/j.biombioe.2019.105437;;;6;Agricultural Engineering| Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology| Energy & Fuels;Agriculture| Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology| Energy & Fuels;JZ5PC;WOS:000505153100001;;Bronze;;;2021-01-01

The potential of microalgae as a plant biostimulant source has been investigated in recent years, while the use of humic substances is well established| however the study of the combination of both is novel, and is the aim of this work. A step-by-step approach was adopted, conducting three experiments using the microalgae Scenedesmus subspiratus combined with humic acid: i) rooting bioassays in a growth chamber to identify bioactivity of microalgae, humic acid and their mixtures using vigna radiata as a model plant. ii) immersion treatments of two onion cultivar seedlings at transplantation which were then grown in pots in a greenhouse, iii) immersion treatments of two onion cultivar (open-pollinated and hybrid) seedlings at transplantation which were then grown at field in organic system. Growth and biochemical variables, yield and nutrient content of onion leaves and bulbs were evaluated. The bioactivity of microalgae biomass, of humic acid and their mixtures were identified on bioassays, and synergy was found. The immersion of onion seedlings in microalgae plus humic acid solutions showed growth promoting effects at the early stages, improved bulb caliber and yield of the hybrid cultivar, and incremented sugars and proteins content in bulbs. The yield gain was not related to nutrients uptake stimuli.;[Gemin, Luiz Gabriel| Mogor, Atila Francisco| Amatussi, Juliana De Oliveira| Mogor, Gilda] Fed Univ Parana UFPR, Rua Funcionarios 1540, BR-80035050 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil;Mogor, AF (corresponding author), Fed Univ Parana UFPR, Rua Funcionarios 1540, BR-80035050 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.;afmogor@gmail.com;Mogor, Atila/AAX-2039-2020;Mogor, Atila/0000-0003-4199-9079;National Research Council of Brazil (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)|  [308029];The first author thanks National Research Council of Brazil (CNPq) for his Doctoral scholarship.| The correspondent author is a Research Member of CNPq and acIcnowledges grant 308029.;;30;4;4;1;45;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0304-4238;1879-1018;;SCI HORTIC-AMSTERDAM;Sci.

However, strategies to overcome this potential stress are still being unraveled. Therefore, the physiological performance and antioxidant mechanisms of two lichen microalgae, Trebouxia sp. (TR9) and Coccomyxa simplex (Csol), were analyzed. TR9 was isolated from Ramalina farinacea, a Mediterranean fruticose epiphytic lichen adapted to xeric habitats, while Csol is the phycobiont of Solorina saccata, a foliaceous lichen that grows on humid rock crevices. The tolerance to desiccation of both species was tested by subjecting them to different drying conditions and to four consecutive daily cycles of D/R. Our results show that a relative humidity close to that of their habitats was crucial to maintain the photosynthetic rates. Concerning antioxidant enzymes, in general, manganese superoxide dismutases (MnSODs) were induced after desiccation and decreased after rehydration. In TR9, catalase (CAT)-A increased, and its activity was maintained after four cycles of D/R. Ascorbate peroxidase activity was detected only in Csol, while glutathione reductase increased only in TR9. Transcript levels of antioxidant enzymes indicate that most isoforms of MnSOD and FeSOD were induced by desiccation and repressed after rehydration. CAT2 gene expression was also upregulated and maintained at higher levels even after four cycles of D/R in accordance with enzymatic activities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to include the complete set of the main antioxidant enzymes in desiccation-tolerant microalgae. The results highlight the speciesspecific induction of the antioxidant system during cyclic D/R, suggesting a priming of oxidative defence metabolism.;[Hell, Aline F.| Gasulla, Francisco| Gonazalez-Hourcade, Maria| del Campo, Eva M.| Casano, Leonardo M.] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Life Sci, Madrid, Spain| [Hell, Aline F.| Centeno, Danilo C.] Fed Univ ABC, Ctr Nat Sci & Humanities, Sao Bernardo Do Campo, SP, Brazil;Casano, LM (corresponding author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Life Sci, Madrid, Spain.;leonardo.casano@uah.es;Gasulla, Francisco/AAB-4893-2019| Centeno, Danilo C/E-9648-2015| Casano, Leonardo M.

Mass and thermal energy balances were written for each phase producing a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE). The solution of the ODE set delivers the temperature and air humidity ratio and biomass profiles with respect to time. The numerical results were directly compared with temperature experimental measurements-for both phases-and with the biomass humidity content. Data from experiment 1 were used to carry out the mathematical model adjustment, whereas data from experiment 2 were used for the experimental validation of the model. The model was adjusted by proposing a new correlation for the mass transfer coefficient and by calibrating the heat transfer coefficient. The transient numerical results were in good quantitative and qualitative agreement with the experimental results, ie, within the experimental error bars. Then the experimentally validated mathematical model was utilized to optimize the following parameters: (i) the electric heater power (Q ? res) and the dry air mass flow rate (m ? da) and (ii) the convection oven length to width ratio (L/W). The goal was to minimize system energy consumption (objective function). The optimization procedure was subject to the following physical constraints: (i) fixed convection oven total volume and (ii) fixed biomass and drying air contact surface area. For the oven original geometry, Q ? res,opt = 3.0 kW and m ? da,opt = 9 g s(-1) were numerically found for minimum energy consumption, so that 36.9% and 43.5% energy consumption decreases were obtained, respectively, in comparison with the measurements of experiment 1. Next, the numerical geometric optimization found (L/W)(opt) = 9, with Q ? res,opt and m ? da,opt, which was capable to reach a 51.6% energy consumption reduction in comparison with the original system tested in experiment 1. The novelty of this work consists of the development and experimental validation of a physically based microalgae biomass drying mathematical model, ie, instead of using empirical correlations to predict the drying time and temperature profiles and then minimize system energy consumption. Therefore, the results show that it is reasonable to state that the model could be used to design, control, and optimize drying systems with configurations similar to the one analyzed in this study.;[Disconzi, Fernanda P.| Balmant, Wellington| Coelho Vargas, Jose Viriato| Peixoto, Pedro H.

Considering the need for efficient and low-cost industrial processes, the aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of microalgae and cyanobacteria to produce intra- and extracellular -galactosidase. Eight species of Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta were cultivated in mixotrophic conditions with lactose as a carbon source. Dunaliella tertiolecta, Chlorella minutissima, and Nannochloropsis oculata were able to grow under mixotrophic conditions showing biomass production and growth rates higher than those of photoautotrophic cultures. -Galactosidase extracellular production was 33.5UL(-1) on the 11th cultivation day for D. tertiolecta. For N. oculata and C. minutissima, the values were 29.6 and 11.02UL(-1) on the 14th and the 7th cultivation days, respectively.

Water samples containing microalgae were initially submitted to the enrichment process, followed by standard procedure for obtaining pure culture. Purified DNA from the microalgae isolates was used for sequencing the amplified 18S rDNA genomic region, which resulted in the identification of Poterioochromonas malhamensis, Chlorella sp., Micractinium sp., Tetradesmus sp. and Desmodesmus sp. All isolated strains were cultivated in 1-L flat-plate PBRs, with the Poterioochromonas malhamensis being the only one to show antibacterial activity in agar diffusion assay. Further, PPEQ-01 strain was cultured under different types and scales of PBR, intensity and spectrum of the incident light, in order to study and prove the antibacterial potential of the strain. Ethanolic and methanolic supernatants, or hydrophilic and methanolic extracts produced from biomass cultivated in different conditions led to formation of bacterial growth inhibition halos around the impregnated disks used in the agar diffusion test. The hydrophilic extract, obtained from biomass cultured under green illumination, exhibited stronger activity against all tested pathogenic bacteria as compared to the other extracts. The results obtained with the new isolated Poterioochromonas malhamensis strain proved efficiency of the innovative complex approach applied to BAC aiming the identification of microalgae that present antimicrobial activity.;[Schuelter, Adilson Ricken| Hinterholz, Camila Larissa| Goes Trigueros, Daniela Estelita| Modenes, Aparecido Nivaldo] West Parana State Univ, Postgrad Program Chem Engn, Rua Fac 645, BR-85903000 Toledo, PR, Brazil| [Kroumov, Alexander Dimitrov] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Stephan Angeloff Inst Microbiol, Dept Appl Microbiol, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria| [Fiorini, Adriana| Vendruscolo, Eliane Gruska] Univ Fed Parana, Rua Pioneiro 2153, BR-85950000 Palotina, Brazil| [Zaharieva, Maya Margaritova] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Stephan Angeloff Inst Microbiol, Dept Infect Microbiol, Acad G Bonchev Str,BL 26, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria;Modenes, AN (corresponding author), West Parana State Univ, Postgrad Program Chem Engn, Rua Fac 645, BR-85903000 Toledo, PR, Brazil.;modenes@unioeste.br;Zaharieva, Maya Margaritova/ABH-8344-2020| Ricken Schuelter, Adilson/Y-9382-2018;Zaharieva, Maya Margaritova/0000-0001-8548-5649| Ricken Schuelter, Adilson/0000-0002-5545-7601;CNPq (National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [400771/2014-4]| CAPESCAPES;The authors would like to give special thanks to CNPq (National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development) for the Special Visiting Researcher Fellowship for Assoc.

In this framework, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the drying kinetics of droplets that mimic the ones formed during spray drying of microalgae dispersions. Drying of a set of one hundred, equal in size droplets of distilled water on a hydrophobic surface was investigated under different temperatures and air velocities. The kinetics of mass loss was described by two conservation equations solved by the BDF numerical method, with convective coefficients tuned on the kinetic results by the Simplex method of optimization. Drying experiments with each dispersion droplet containing approximately nine to ten thousand spherical particles of microalgae were also performed. The period of drying governed by convection was again properly described by energy and water mass balances without involving any further adjustable parameter. The water transfer through the microalgae was correctly represented by the analytical solution of the Fick's second law for a sphere with negligible external resistances to mass transfer, and a tuned diffusivity of 1.4 x 10(-13) m(2) s(-1).;[Biz, Ana Paula| Zanoelo, Everton Fernando] Univ Fed Parana, Grad Program Food Engn, Curitiba, PR, Brazil| [Cardozo-Filho, Lucio] Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Chem Engn, Maringa, PR, Brazil| [Cardozo-Filho, Lucio] Ctr Univ Fundacao Ensino Octavio Bastos UNIFEOB, Sao Joao Da Boa Vista, SP, Brazil| [Zanoelo, Everton Fernando] Univ Fed Parana, Grad Program Chem Engn, Curitiba, PR, Brazil;Zanoelo, EF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Grad Program Food Engn, Curitiba, PR, Brazil.;everton.zanoelo@ufpr.br;Zanoelo, Everton/U-4490-2019| Biz, Ana Paula/X-1336-2019;;FA/CNPq [115/2018 - PRONEX FA/CNPq, 50579];Prof. Marcos Corazza is gratefully acknowledged for providing commercial samples of the used microalga.

Populations of this species were exposed during 48 h to a three-factor experimental design (3 x 2 x 2) with two artificial pH values (6, 7.4), two levels of temperature (23 degrees C, 28 degrees C), two levels of salinity (34 psu, 40 psu) and a control (pH 8, Temp 23 degrees C, Sal 34 psu). The effects on growth, cell viability, metabolic activity, and inherent cell properties (size, complexity and autofluorescence) of P. tricornutum were studied using flow cytometry. The results showed adverse effects on cultures exposed to pH 6 and high temperature and salinity, being the inherent cell properties themost sensitive response. Also, linked effects of these parameters resulted on cell viability and cell size decrease and an increase of cell autofluorescence. The conclusions obtained from this work are useful to address the potential effects of climate change (in terms of changes on pH, salinity and temperature) in microalgae. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The biomass of the microalgae Spirulina maxima acted as a good corrosion inhibitor reaching an inhibition efficiency of 96.4% after 72 h of immersion for an inhibitor concentration of 100 mg L-1. The Ea increased with the addition of the inhibitor that characterizes the physical adsorption of the molecules present in the biomass of microalgae on the surface. This adsorption blocked the anodic and cathodic sites. The HMWF isolated from the total biomass showed an inhibition efficiency equal to the total biomass, which suggests that the macromolecules as proteins are probably responsible for the inhibitory action observed by the microalgae biomass.;[Rodrigues, Larissa Soares| do Valle, Anita Ferreira| D'Elia, Eliane] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Quim, Ctr Tecnol, Ave Athos da Silveira Ramos 149,Bloco A, BR-21941909 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil;D'Elia, E (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Quim, Ctr Tecnol, Ave Athos da Silveira Ramos 149,Bloco A, BR-21941909 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;eliane@iq.ufrj.br;D'Elia, Eliane/G-3519-2012;D'Elia, Eliane/0000-0001-5238-1165;CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [309353/ 2015-7, 153940/2015-8, 424306/2016]| FAPERJ (Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro)Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) [E-26/010.001675/ 2014];This work was supported by CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) [Grant Number 309353/ 2015-7, 153940/2015-8 and 424306/2016] and by FAPERJ (Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro) [Grant Number E-26/010.001675/ 2014].;;44;4;5;0;7;ESG;BELGRADE;BORIVOJA STEVANOVICA 25-7, BELGRADE, 11000, SERBIA;1452-3981;;;INT J ELECTROCHEM SC;Int.

Scenedesmus sp. was the dominant genus in the phytoplankton community in both of the evaluated effluents. The different nutritional conditions affected the production of biomass, which reached 1,160 mg/L of volatile suspended solids (VSS) and 371 mg/L of VSS with cultivation in the primary (PE) and secondary effluents (SE), respectively. In both effluents, great removal efficiencies close to quantification limits were observed for ammoniacal nitrogen and soluble phosphorus. Regarding the accumulation of lipids, there were no considerable differences between the effluents. The highest lipid productivity that was observed in the PE, which reached 3.7 g/m(2).d, was attributed to its larger production of biomass as a consequence of its better nutritional condition in relation to the SE.;[Tango, Mariana Daniel| Calijuri, Maria Lucia| Assemany, Paula Peixoto| do Couto, Eduardo de Aguiar] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Civil Engn, Environm Engn Grp nPA, Campus Vicosa, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil;Tango, MD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Civil Engn, Environm Engn Grp nPA, Campus Vicosa, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.;tango.mariana@gmail.com;Calijuri, ML/G-1546-2012| Couto, Eduardo A do/I-4426-2014| Tango, Mariana/M-9180-2019| Assemany, Paula Peixoto/E-1248-2014;Calijuri, ML/0000-0002-0918-2475| Couto, Eduardo A do/0000-0002-2976-9302| Tango, Mariana/0000-0003-4746-2985| Assemany, Paula Peixoto/0000-0001-7596-7804;Technology and the Research Support Foundation of Minas Gerais - FAPEMIG [TEC-APQ-01892-16];The authors acknowledge the financial assistance provided by the Technology and the Research Support Foundation of Minas Gerais - FAPEMIG (grant number TEC-APQ-01892-16).;;26;4;4;0;6;IWA PUBLISHING;LONDON;ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND;0273-1223;1996-9732;;WATER SCI TECHNOL;Water Sci.

An in vitro assay against F. verticillioides was carried out using maize grains as the culture medium. An open-field experiment was carried out in Northwest Italy under natural infection conditions. The compared treatments were factorial combinations of two insecticide treatments (an untreated control and pyrethroid, used against European Corn Borer), four antifungal treatments (an untreated control, MPE from Spirulina sp., MPE from Nannochloropsis sp., and a synthetic fungicide), and two timings of the application of the antifungal compounds (at maize flowering and at the milk stage). The MPE compounds were capable of inhibiting fumonisin production in vitro more efficiently than tebuconazole. Insecticide application reduced the infection by Fusarium species and subsequent fumonisin contamination. However, fumonisins in maize fields were not significantly controlled by either fungicide or MPE application.;[Scaglioni, Priscila Tessmer] Univ Fed Pelotas, Ctr Ciencias Quim Farmaceut & Alimentos, BR-96160000 Capao Do Leao, RS, Brazil| [Blandino, Massimo| Scarpino, Valentina| Giordano, Debora| Testa, Giulio] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Agr Forestali & Alimentari, Largo Braccini 2, I-10095 Turin, Italy| [Badiale-Furlong, Eliana] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Escola Quim & Alimentos, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil;Scaglioni, PT (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pelotas, Ctr Ciencias Quim Farmaceut & Alimentos, BR-96160000 Capao Do Leao, RS, Brazil.;priscilascaglioni@gmail.com;Blandino, Massimo/AAN-5871-2020| Giordano, Debora/L-2628-2019| Scaglioni, Priscila Tessmer/J-8378-2013| Furlong, Eliana Badiale/AAE-4008-2019;Blandino, Massimo/0000-0003-3719-2520| Scaglioni, Priscila Tessmer/0000-0003-4420-1229| Scarpino, Valentina/0000-0002-9994-9907;Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) through the Programa Institutional de Bolsas de Doutorado Sanduiche no Exterior (PDSE) [BEX 2384/15-9];The authors are grateful to Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) for supporting this study through the Programa Institutional de Bolsas de Doutorado Sanduiche no Exterior (PDSE, BEX 2384/15-9).;;34;4;4;0;17;AMER CHEMICAL SOC;WASHINGTON;1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0021-8561;1520-5118;;J AGR FOOD CHEM;J.

A case study with Desmodesmus subspicatus;PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES;English;Article;;SOLAR DISINFECTION SODIS| PHOTOSYSTEM-II| WATER| H2O2| ENHANCEMENT| DAMAGE;Increased concentrations of nutrients in water bodies caused by effluent discharge, fertilizers and other inputs can lead to artificial eutrophication, increasing the primary productivity, bringing well-known and serious consequences to the environment (such as excessive macrophyte and microalgae growth). Most strategies for phytoplankton control in aquatic ecosystems result in metal accumulation or toxic by-product formation after chlorination. Concerning this matter, the photo-Fenton process (usually applied in wastewater treatment and degradation of a variety of contaminants) has been studied for water and effluent disinfection. However, its application in microalgae inactivation has not been reported until now. Therefore, this work aimed to evaluate the process effectiveness in inactivating microalgae, using Desmodesmus subspicatus as a model. Photo-Fenton experiments were carried out at the lab scale, at 105 cells per mL with 20 mg L-1 of H2O2 and 5 mg L-1 of Fe2+ (complexed with oxalic acid). The cell concentration and Growth Inhibition Test (GIT) were used to evaluate the process efficiency and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to analyze any alterations in the cell morphology. After performing the photo-Fenton reaction, the individual contribution of the reactants and radiation was investigated. The cell concentration was not significantly reduced during the photo-Fenton reaction, but SEM images indicated possible morphology alterations and the GIT showed the loss of cell viability after 30 minutes of exposure. Effects on the cell growth were also observed when exposed only to hydrogen peroxide.;[Torres, Mariana de Almeida] Univ Fed Parana, Postgrad Program Ecol & Conservat, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [de Liz, Marcus Vinicius| Rocha Martins, Lucia Regina| Freitas, Adriane Martins] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana, Dept Chem & Biol, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil;Torres, MD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Postgrad Program Ecol & Conservat, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.| Freitas, AM (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Fed Parana, Dept Chem & Biol, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.;marianatorres@ufpr.br| adrianefreitas@utfpr.edu.br;MARTINS, LUCIA/AAY-5082-2020| Martins, Lucia/AAE-5915-2020| de Almeida Torres, Mariana/AAE-6315-2020| Liz, Marcus/T-2754-2017;MARTINS, LUCIA/0000-0002-9018-7176| de Almeida Torres, Mariana/0000-0003-3136-1952| Liz, Marcus/0000-0003-1370-3365| Martins de Freitas, Adriane/0000-0002-9237-8435;CAPESCAPES| CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [472233/2013-0]| Multiuser Material Characterization Center - UTFPR;The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by CAPES (scholarship) and CNPq (process 472233/2013-0), IAP for the Desmodesmus subspicatus strain, and Multiuser Material Characterization Center - UTFPR.;;25;4;4;2;13;ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY;CAMBRIDGE;THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND;1474-905X;1474-9092;;PHOTOCH PHOTOBIO SCI;Photochem.

The goal is to obtain representative algae shapes to extract morphological features to be employed in a posterior step of taxonomical classification of the species. The proposed methodology relies on the seeded region growing principle and on a fine-tuned filtering preprocessing stage to smooth the input image. A contrast enhancement process then takes place to highlight algae regions on a binary pre-segmentation image. This binary image is also employed to determine where to place the seed points and to estimate the statistical probability distributions that characterize the target regions, i.e., the algae areas and the background, respectively. These preliminary stages produce the required information to set the homogeneity criterion for region growing. We evaluate the proposed methodology by comparing its resulting segmentations with a set of corresponding ground-truth segmentations (provided by an expert biologist) and also with segmentations obtained with existing strategies. The experimental results show that our solution achieves highly accurate segmentation rates with greater efficiency, as compared with the performance of standard segmentation approaches and with an alternative previous solution, based on level-sets, also specialized to handle this particular problem.;[Borges, Vinicius R.

Strains of two native microalgae from the stabilization lagoon (Desmodesmus sp. and Scenedesmus sp.) were grown in three different media: filtered effluent, autoclaved filtered effluent and conventional medium for cultivation of freshwater microalgae. Environmental analysis was carried out within the methodological framework of the LCA, by the life cycle impact assessment method ReCiPe 2008. A comparative analysis was performed for three endpoint categories: damage to human health, damage to ecosystem diversity and damage to resource availability. For both microalgal strains, the results confirmed that microalgal biomass production in non-autoclaved effluent has the lowest potential environmental impact. An additional analysis indicated that the potential environmental impact caused by discharge of effluents treated with microalgae is higher than the impact of untreated effluents. Despite the decrease in N and P in the effluent after microalgal treatment, the potential environmental impact of its discharge is strongly correlated with the electric consumption required for microalgal cultivation. This consumption could be lowered by decreasing the expenditure for illumination and mixing using outdoor microalgal cultivation.;[Diniz, Graciela S.| Chaloub, Ricardo M.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Biotecnol Vegetal, BR-21941590 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil| [Tourinho, Tiago C.

Doing so, each cell would have better exposure to light and nutrients. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be an effective tool for understanding and predicting the multiphase flow inside tanks. In this study, we have used CFD to simulate the velocity field and the turbulent kinetic energy inside a computational tank to find best hydrodynamic performance for two nozzles configurations: case 1) one single 3 mm air nozzle| case 2) a set of nine 1 mm air nozzles. Computational results showed that smaller air nozzles are more efficient in reducing dead zones inside culturing tanks. Further, mean turbulent kinetic energy field suggested a more homogeneous dissipation, and higher intensities of turbulence were observed in the smaller nozzle simulation. The application of present numerical observations on culture systems was investigated by several experiments in 300 L cylindrical photobioreactors and 1600 L open circular tanks, both with different air nozzles sizes (1 and 3 mm) where the marine microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica was grown. Microalga growth was determined by measurements of water absorbance at 750 nm. Higher cell densities were determined in the photobioreactors and tanks with 1 mm nozzles. Thus, smaller nozzle was efficient to improve the microalga production even with increasing volume and different culture system designs, supporting the numerical analyses predictions by CFD.;[Kubelka, Bruno Galler| Abreu, Paulo Cesar] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Aquaculture Marine Stn, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil| [Kubelka, Bruno Galler| Pinto, Waldir Terra] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Engn Sch, Lab Fluid Struct Interact, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil;Kubelka, BG (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Aquaculture Marine Stn, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.;brunokubelka@furg.br;Abreu, Paulo Cesar/A-5145-2013;Abreu, Paulo Cesar/0000-0002-7657-1112| Kubelka, Bruno/0000-0001-5014-1854;Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - CAPESCAPES| project Costs and productivity evaluation for massive microalgae cultivation for biodiesel production;B.

Besides cell and other chemical species concentrations, temperature and local solar irradiation are important variables to be assessed. Three different experiments were conducted to adjust and validate the mathematical model for which a methodology based on the coefficient of determination is introduced. The first experiment was performed in a 100L prototype PBR, the second in a column 78.5L air-lift PBR, and the third in a 12,000L compact tubular PBR. Initially, cell growth numerical simulation curves were directly compared with data from the first experiment, which resulted in a coefficient of determination R-2=0.4043, showing that model adjustment was needed. As a result, 3 adjustment parameters were defined: (i) local solar irradiation ((1))| (ii) medium CO2 concentration ((2))| and (iii) nutrient concentration ((3)). Then, the first experiment data set was used to solve an inverse problem of parameter estimation, obtaining (1)=1.05, (2)=0.95, and (3)=0.18, which resulted in R-2=0.98584. Next, cell growth numerical simulation curves were compared with measured data from the second and third experiments, obtaining R-2=0.9862 and R-2=0.82969, respectively. With the experimentally validated model, a 29day (or 696hours) simulation of microalgae cultivation was conducted to calculate the 12,000L PBR microalgae-derived oil production, which allowed for the projection of the microalgae species Acutodesmus obliquus oil productivity as approximately 2300Lha(-1)yr(-1), considering 11.4% microalgae dry biomass lipid content. Such low production demonstrates that achieving an economically viable process for microalgae-derived biofuels will require more technological advances and the development of highly optimized processes.;[Ribeiro, R.

The use of this effluent as a low-cost alternative cultivation medium for microalgae could represent a viable supplementary treatment. We cultivated 11 microalgae species with potential use for biodiesel production to assess their growth capacities in biodiesel industrial washing waters. Only Monoraphidium contortum, Ankistrodesmus sp., Chlorococcum sp., and one unidentified Chlorophyceae species grew effectively in that effluent. M. contortum showed the highest growth capacity and had the second highest fatty acid content (267.9 mg g(-1) of DW), predominantly producing palmitic (20.9%), 7,10,13-hexadecatrienoic (14%), oleic (16.2%), linoleic (10.5%), and linolenic acids (23.2%). In the second phase of the experiment, the microalgae were cultivated in biodiesel wash water at 75% of its initial concentration as well as in WC (control) medium. After 21 days of cultivation, 25.8 and 7.2% of the effluent nitrate and phosphate were removed, respectively, and the chemical oxygen demand was diminished by 31.2%. These results suggest the possibility of cultivating biodiesel producing microalgae in industrial wash water effluents.;[Petraglia Sassi, Patricia Giulianna| Calixto, Clediana Dantas| da Silva Santana, Jordana Kaline| Sassi, Roberto| Costa Sassi, Cristiane Francisca] Univ Fed Paraiba, Lab Ambientes Recifais & Biotecnol Microalgas LAR, Ctr Ciencias Exatas & Nat, Campus 1, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil| [Abrahao, Raphael] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Engn Energias Renovaveis, Ctr Energias Alternat & Renovaveis, Campus 1, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil;Sassi, PGP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Lab Ambientes Recifais & Biotecnol Microalgas LAR, Ctr Ciencias Exatas & Nat, Campus 1, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.;petraglia.pgps@gmail.com;Abrahao, Raphael/AAC-6299-2019;Abrahao, Raphael/0000-0002-2945-2604;;;;77;4;4;1;14;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;0944-1344;1614-7499;;ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R;Environ.

Thus, the present work evaluated the capacity of lyophilized biomass of the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (Chlorophyta) in lanthanum-La biosorption, aiming its use in the separation of rare earths. The biosorption assays were conducted in batch and their residual concentrations were determined using ICP-OES. It was found that the biosorption of ionic species depended on the initial pH of each assay. The biosorption capacity was higher at lower pH values. Since the zero charge point was determined in pH value of 5.59, the conclusion is that anionic species of La are present in solution. The values of qmax reveal the biosorption capacity of the ionic species of La by the biomass of C. vulgaris, which presented a value of 1.11 mg/g (0.8 mmol/g). The isotherms showed that, under the experimental conditions evaluated, the biosorption of La occurs according to the model proposed by Freundlich, in a process of reversible adsorption in a heterogeneous system.;[Heidelmann, G.

The patch-forming Asterionellopsis &clans sensu lato (A. glacialis s.l.) is the main producer in a rich food chain in Cassino Beach, southern Brazil. This work aimed to verify the influence of sediment particles on the quantity and composition of carbohydrates produced in cultures with A. glacialis s.l. and to investigate the relationship between carbohydrate composition and bacterial abundance. The non-axenic diatom, isolated from Cassino Beach, was batch cultivated for nine days with calcined sediment (CS), fresh sediment (FR), and without sediment (Ctrl). Higher cell counts (p<0.05), as well as aggregates comprising bubbles, algal cells, and sand occurred in CS and FR. These results indicate that sediment influences growth and aggregate formation, possibly through shading. The highest amounts of dissolved and particulate carbohydrates were found in Ctrl (6.64 +/- 1.6 mg L-1) and FR (303 +/- 3.3 mg L-1), respectively. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) characterization of particulate carbohydrates showed increases with time in rhamnose, xylose and arabinose in all treatments. The increase of these carbohydrates has the potential to cause A. glacialis s. I. to settle or float by influencing mucus thickness and adhesiveness. A significant decrease (p < 0.005) in bacterial counts occurred when particulate carbohydrates with a very distinct composition (mainly rhamnose and galacturonic acid) appeared on day 9, indicating that compositional changes in the particulate carbohydrates affect bacterial abundance.

In this context, state estimation plays an important role, and software sensors should be robust to model uncertainties and measurement noise. In this study, two software sensors are designed in the form of extended Luenberger observers, using Lyapunov arguments and linear matrix inequalities (LMI). These observers are based on Droop model and a few available on-line sensors. The first observer design estimates the intracellular quota and substrate concentrations considering a linear differential inclusion modeling technique and a constant observer gain. On the other hand, the second one estimates only the intracellular quota concentration assuming uncertainties in the model parameters and a quasi-Linear Parameter Varying (quasi-LPV) representation of the nonlinear system. The results are presented considering simulated and experimental data from Dunaliella tertiolecta culture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, further knowledge on this subject is still needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of culture growth conditions (nutrient fractionation) on the cell biomass levels, fatty acid profile, as well as the content of fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) of freshwater microalgae Choricystis minor var. minor. The experiment consisted in determining the culture growth (biomass levels) employing WC medium in two treatments: full initial addition (100%) and fractional addition of nutrients on three specific days. The biomass produced was harvested in the exponential and stationary phases of the growth curve. No significant differences were found in the biomass levels (approximately 0.5 g l(-1) at 8 days of culture) using different treatments. The FAME yields varied between 213.7 and 276.8 mg g(-1) of dry biomass. Regarding the qualitative composition, fatty acid profiles were similar under tested culture growth conditions, whereas the quantitative content changed between them. The results from this investigation suggested that cultivation with full initial nutrient addition and biomass harvested at the stationary phase provided higher FAME yield and lower tri-unsaturated fatty acids (9.6%) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (4.0%) levels. Because of these characteristics, this culture growth conditions represent, among the studied strategies, the most interesting for Choricystis minor var. minor cultivation in order to produce biodiesel.

Periphyton samples were obtained within a more general program, in fishery tanks and streams situated in the upper basin region of Tibagi River, nearby Londrina, Parana state, south of Brazil. The present work proposes new algorithms for the determination of algal species volume. Results showed that Gyrosigma scalproides (Rabenhorst) Cleve 1894 and Tetraedron gracile (Reinsch) Hansgirg 1889 were exceptions inside their genus and the present new formula for biovolume and area gives more adequate results. In addition, new formulas applied for Phacus longicauda (Ehrenberg) Dujardin 1841 and Kirchneriella lunaris (Kirchner) Mobius 1894 also showed much more accurate results than in the previous works. The difference in the calculations of biovolume between the present method and others was not small and could not be neglected.;[Konoplya, Barbara Idino| Soares, Francisco Striquer] Univ Estadual Londrina, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Anim & Vegetal, BR-86051990 Londrina, PR, Brazil;Konoplya, BI (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Londrina, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Anim & Vegetal, BR-86051990 Londrina, PR, Brazil.;barbcast_1@yahoo.com.br;;;UEL/CONFEPAR/FAUEL| UEL (Universidade Estadual de Londrina);This work was supported by the agreement UEL/CONFEPAR/FAUEL and by the scientific initiation support provided by UEL (Universidade Estadual de Londrina).;;23;4;5;0;9;INST TECNOLOGIA PARANA;CURITIBA-PARANA;RUA PROF ALGACYR MUNHOZ MADER 3775-CIC, 81350-010 CURITIBA-PARANA, BRAZIL;1516-8913;;;BRAZ ARCH BIOL TECHN;Braz.

In the present study, environmental impacts of the production of microalgae biomass-based phosphate biofertilizer compared to triple superphosphate through life-cycle assessment conducted in the Simapro (R) software were investigated. The functional unit of the analysis was 163 g of P for both fertilizers. Phosphorus was recovered from a meat processing industry effluent in a high-rate algal pond. Impacts related to the entire biofertilizer chain impacted mainly on climate changes (3.17 kg CO(2)eq). Microalgae biofertilizer had higher environmental impact than conventional fertilizer in all impact categories, highlighting climate change and terrestrial ecotoxicity. An ideal scenario was created considering that: all energy used comes from photovoltaic panels| in the separation step a physical method will be used, without energy expenditure (i.e. gravimetric sedimentation) and| biomass will be dried in a drying bed instead of the thermal drying. In this scenario, the impact of biofertilizer approached considerably those of triple superphosphate. When impacts of biomass cultivation and concentration stages were disregarded, drying step was of great relevance, contributing to increase biofertilizer impacts. More research is needed to optimize the algae production chain and determine the possibility of obtaining higher added value products more environmental attractive.<bold> </bold>;[Castro, Jackeline de Siqueira| Calijuri, Maria Lucia| Ferreira, Jessica| Ribeiro, Vinicius Jose] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Civil Engn, Av Peter Henry Rolfs S-N,Campus Univ Fed Vicosa, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil| [Assemany, Paula Peixoto] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Water Resources & Sanitat, Campus Univ, BR-37200900 Lavras, MG, Brazil;Castro, JD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Civil Engn, Av Peter Henry Rolfs S-N,Campus Univ Fed Vicosa, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.;jackelinesiqueiracastro@yahoo.com.br;Calijuri, ML/G-1546-2012| Assemany, Paula Peixoto/E-1248-2014| Ribeiro, Vinicius/AAM-4908-2020;Calijuri, ML/0000-0002-0918-2475| Assemany, Paula Peixoto/0000-0001-7596-7804| Ribeiro, Vinicius/0000-0003-0023-5806| Ferreira, Jessica/0000-0002-9293-2475;FAPEMIG -Minas Gerais Research FoundationMinas Gerais State Research Foundation (FAPEMIG) [APQ-01892-16]| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES)CAPES [001];Authors would like to thank the FAPEMIG -Minas Gerais Research Foundation (grant number APQ-01892-16) and Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) -Finance Code 001.;;55;3;3;13;15;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0048-9697;1879-1026;;SCI TOTAL ENVIRON;Sci.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the hemato-immunological, and histological parameters and gut microbiota of Nile tilapia fed with the microalga Schizochytrium sp. Males of Nile tilapia were distributed among eight net cages (6 m(3)), and fed for 105 days with two diets: control (CON), without Schizochytrium sp., and supplemented (SUP), with 1.2% Schizochytrium sp. in the diet. The final weight, mortality, hemato-crit, total erythrocyte count (RBC), hemoglobin, hematimetric indices, white blood cell count (WBC), total protein, and serum lysozyme were measured. Alterations in intestinal morphology were evaluated. The gut microbiota was evaluated with next-generation sequencing. No significant differences (p>0.05) were found in the final weight and mortality between diets. Regarding the hematological parameters, a difference (p<0.05) was detected only in RBC, with there being lower values in the SUP, although this group also showed a tendency toward having an increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin level. There were no differences (p>0.05) in total protein and serum lysozyme concentrations or in WBCs between diets, except for lymphocytes, which presented lower values (p<0.05) in the SUP, suggesting immunomodulation by the polyunsaturated fatty acids present in the microalga. There was no difference (p>0.05) in the intestinal morphology between diets. Metagenomic data indicated greater richness (represented by the Chao index) and a higher abundance of the bacterial phylum Firmicutes in the gut microbiota of the tilapia fed with the SUP diet, demonstrating that the digestion and use of the components of the microalga could influence the microbial community. The results indicated that the microalga had modulatory effects on blood cells and the intestinal microbiota, without affecting the structure and integrity of the intestinal villi.;[de Souza, Felipe Pinheiro| Suzuki de Lima, Ed Christian| Urrea-Rojas, Angela Maria| Lopera-Barrero, Nelson Mauricio] Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Anim Sci, Londrina, Parana, Brazil| [Suphoronski, Suelen Aparecida| Facimoto, Cesar Toshio| Silva de Oliveira, Thalita Evani| Pereira, Ulisses de Padua| Di Santis, Giovana Wingeter] Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Vet Prevent Med, Londrina, Parana, Brazil| [Bezerra Junior, Jailton da Silva| Lopes de Oliveira, Carlos Antonio] Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Anim Sci, Maringa, Parana, Brazil;Lopera-Barrero, NM (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Anim Sci, Londrina, Parana, Brazil.;nmlopera@uel.br;de Oliveira, Thalita Evani Silva/R-3865-2018;de Oliveira, Thalita Evani Silva/0000-0001-6894-9253| Pinheiro de Souza, Felipe/0000-0003-3436-4147;Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel superior (CAPES)CAPES| onselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cienti'fico e Tecnologico (Cnpq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| Fundacao Araucaia;This study was supported by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel superior (CAPES), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cienti ' fico e Tecnologico (Cnpq), and Fundacao Araucaia for their support of this work.

Moreover, ZnO NPs can also be employed in fertilizers as a source of zinc micronutrient, which is a primary element for enzymes and proteins synthesis in plants, allowing their regular growth and improving crop productivity. However, the extensive use of nanoparticles as a source of fertilizers in agricultural activities also raises concerns once nanoparticle features including surface charge, chemical fucntionalittes, size and shape can alter the toxicity of NPs. In this scenario, the toxicity of distinct ZnO NPs towards microalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, which is the base microorganism for the aquatic food chain, was evaluated and compared. ZnO NPs employed here were obtained by co-precipitation method and co-precipitation followed by hydrothermal method using different times. After characterizing the physical-chemical properties of ZnO NPs, they were employed in toxicity biossays in order to evaluate their ability to inhibit algal growth as well as to induce changes in algae morphology. Our results indicate that ZnO NPs concentrations below 10 mg L-1 presented low toxicity towards P. subcapitata microalgae. Higher concentrations of ZnO NPs, however, presented significant toxic effects, and revealed changes in morphology of the algae cells, and therefore, should be avoided for agri-related applications.;[Pereira, Flavia F.| Paris, Elaine C.| Bresolin, Joana D.| Mitsuyuki, Milene C.| Ferreira, Marcos D.| Correa, Daniel S.] Embrapa Instrumentacao, Nanotechnol Natl Lab Agr LNNA, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| [Pereira, Flavia F.| Ferreira, Marcos D.| Correa, Daniel S.] Fed Univ Sao Carlos UFSCar, Ctr Exact Sci & Technol, PPG Biotec, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil;Correa, DS (corresponding author), Embrapa Instrumentacao, Nanotechnol Natl Lab Agr LNNA, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.| Correa, DS (corresponding author), Fed Univ Sao Carlos UFSCar, Ctr Exact Sci & Technol, PPG Biotec, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;;Correa, Daniel/B-5660-2008;Correa, Daniel/0000-0002-5592-0627| Pereira, Flavia/0000-0002-4862-8273| Paris, Elaine Cristina/0000-0001-8599-9674;Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) from BrazilFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/17528-8, 2017/12174-4]| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), MCTI-SisNano from BrazilNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [CNPq/402.287/2013-4]| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES) from BrazilCAPES [001]| Rede Agronano (EMBRAPA) from Brazil;The authors thank the financial support from Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) (grant numbers: 2013/17528-8 and 2017/12174-4), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), MCTI-SisNano (CNPq/402.287/2013-4), Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)-Codigo de Financiamento 001 and Rede Agronano (EMBRAPA) from Brazil.;;75;3;3;11;120;AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS;VALENCIA;26650 THE OLD RD, STE 208, VALENCIA, CA 91381-0751 USA;1533-4880;1533-4899;;J NANOSCI NANOTECHNO;J.

It is a promising raw material for several bioproducts, due to high growth rate, CO2 biofixation, and nutrient assimilation from wastewater and does not require large areas for cultivation compared to conventional crops. This study characterized six microalgae (Chlorella sp., C. vulgaris, Desmodesmus sp., D. brasiliensis, Botryococcus braunii, and B. terribilis) regarding growth parameters, total protein, carbohydrate, lipid, ash, and chlorophyll contents. The focus was lipid composition| thus, detailed results of fatty acid profile and polar lipid identification in total lipids are presented. The highest biomass productivity (42.6 mg L-1 day(-1)) and third highest lipid content (21.9%) were achieved by C. vulgaris, with 23.0% alpha -linolenic and 5.6% gamma -linolenic in total fatty acids. Both are of interest for food and pharmaceutical industries and a vegan alternative to currently consumed fish oil. B. braunii showed higher lipid accumulation, oleic acid as the major fatty acid, but significantly low growth rate. B. terribilis presented intense lipid accumulation, at intra- and extracellular levels, but a high percentage of lipids should be hydrocarbons. Lipid and biomass characterization identified different bioproducts and high-value food additives that could be explored to establish a multi-product biorefinery instead of focusing exclusively on biodiesel production, which has been extensively studied but is not economic competitive in the current market.;[Ferreira, Gabriela F.| Rios Pinto, Luisa F.| Maciel Filho, Rubens| Fregolente, Leonardo, V] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Chem Engn FEQ, UNICAMP, 500 Albert Einsten Av, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil| [Carvalho, Patricia O.] Sao Francisco Univ, USF, Braganca Paulista, SP, Brazil| [Coelho, Mirela B.| Eberlin, Marcos N.] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Chem IQ, Dept Organ Chem, Thomson Mass Spectrometry Lab,UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil| [Eberlin, Marcos N.] Univ Prebiteriana Mackenzie, Sch Engn, BR-01302907 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil;Pinto, LFR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Chem Engn FEQ, UNICAMP, 500 Albert Einsten Av, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil.;luisa.rpinto@yahoo.com;;Carvalho, Patricia de/0000-0002-2681-7022| Fregolente, Leonardo/0000-0002-3271-4732| Eberlin, Marcos Nogueira/0000-0003-4868-0618;National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [166844/2017-9]| Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2014/10064-9, 2015/20630-4];This study was supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), grant #166844/2017-9, and the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), grants #2014/10064-9 and 2015/20630-4.;;103;3;3;7;7;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;2190-6815;2190-6823;;BIOMASS CONVERS BIOR;Biomass Convers.

In this study, coagulation followed by dissolved air flotation (DAF) was used as a harvesting method for Chlorella sorokiniana cultivated in wastewater. The harvesting performance was evaluated using four coagulants (aluminum sulphate, ferric chloride, Tanfloc SG and Zetag 8185) usually used in water or wastewater treatment. All coagulants tested showed high flotation efficiency at different conditions of dosage, pH and flotation velocity. The optimal doses were 10 mg L-1 Zetag 8185| 75 mg L-1 Tanfloc SG| 500 mg L-1 Al-2(SO4)(3), and 1000 mg L-1 FeCl3 at pH 7, which showed the maximum efficiency of 98.4, 94.5, 95.4, 96.7% at 8 cm.min(-1), respectively. Moreover, the photobioreactor effluent quality significantly improved after harvesting tests using the optimal doses. High removal was reached for turbidity (93.7-96.2 %), apparent color (91.7-92.3 %), TKN (90.2-92.6%), total phosphorus (89.4-90.9 %) and TSS (88.6-92.5 %).

Enzymatic pretreatments are applied for inducing cell damage/lysis and organic matter solubilisation and this way increasing biogas production. We evaluated enzymatic pretreatments in different conditions for comparing in relation to cell wall rupture, increase of soluble material and increase in biogas production through anaerobic digestion performance in BMP assay. Chlorella sorokiniana cultures were subjected to three different enzymatic pretreatments, each under four different conditions of enzyme/substrate ratio, pH and application time. The results showed increases over 21% in biogas productions for all enzymatic pretreatments. Enzymatic pretreatment was effective at damaging microalgae cell wall, releasing organic compounds and increasing the rate and final methane yield in BMP tests.

C. vulgaris was cultivated in a synthetic solution with a single or ternary metal system. Biomass growth was well predicted considering a competitive inhibition model. The higher specific growth rate (0.34 d(-1)), biomass productivity (98.1 mg . L-1 . d(-1)), heavy metals uptake efficiency (85%) was obtained for the cultures with Cd and Zn ions. The higher nutrient removal was observed in the presence of Cd ions (91% nitrogen and 99% phosphorus). The highest inhibition on biomass growth (> 88%) was observed in the presence of nickel ions. In the ternary system, microalgae growth inhibition was similar to that observed in the presence of only nickel ions. Although, wastewaters containing nutrients and residual concentrations of zinc and cadmium ions can be used for C. vulgaris production, in the presence of residual concentrations of nickel ions, biomass growth is negligible.;[Santos, Francisca M.| Pires, Jose C.

However, the use of pentoses (C5) in the cultivation of microalgae is still not widely studied and only recently the first metabolic pathway for pentose absorption in microalgae was proposed. So, the objective of this work was to evaluate if the use of pentoses affects the growth and carbohydrates content of Chlorella minutissima, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella homosphaera and Dunaliella salina. The kinetic parameters, carbohydrate and protein content and the theoretical potential for ethanol production were estimated for all strains. The highest cellular concentrations (1.25 g L-1) were obtained for D. salina with 5% of pentoses. The addition of pentoses leads to high levels of carbohydrates for C. minutissima (58.6%) cultured with 5% of pentoses, and from this biomass, it is possible to determine a theoretical production of ethanol of 38 mL per 100 g of biomass. The pentoses affect the growth and the biomass composition of the studied strains, generating biomass with potential use for bioethanol production.;[Bastos de Freitas, Barbara Catarina| Bracher, Eduarda Holz| de Morais, Etiele Greque| Vieira Costa, Jorge Alberto] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Lab Biochem Engn, POB 474, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, Brazil| [Pires Atala, Daniel Ibraim] Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Chem Proc, UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil| [de Morais, Michele Greque] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Lab Microbiol & Biochem, Rio Grande, Brazil;Costa, JAV (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande, Coll Chem & Food Engn, Lab Biochem Engn, POB 474, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, Brazil.;jorgealbertovc@terra.com.br;Costa, Jorge A V/L-3999-2013| Freitas, Barbara Catarina B F/D-6132-2019| Morais, Etiele G/W-1934-2018| de Morais, Michele Greque/J-7539-2015;Costa, Jorge A V/0000-0001-8042-7642| Freitas, Barbara Catarina B F/0000-0002-5059-4383| Morais, Etiele G/0000-0003-2993-8572| de Morais, Michele Greque/0000-0001-8920-2896;CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel)CAPES;The authors are grateful to CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel) for the financial support that enabled this research.;;28;3;4;2;20;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0959-3330;1479-487X;;ENVIRON TECHNOL;Environ.

Benthic microalgae assemblages are regulated by both abiotic (e.g., nutrient) and biotic (e.g., grazing) factors. Here, we focus on how benthic communities have changed along the seasonality and availability of nutrients in reservoir waters. We used three reservoirs from the Neotropical semi-arid region to investigate changes in water nutrient concentrations that determine the structural attributes of microalgae and how food quality (algae group dominance) is reflected in the density and taxonomic richness of herbivorous macroinvertebrates. These environments sustain a benthic macroinvertebrate community dominated by scrapers, while at the same time, we found a community of microalgae represented mainly by cyanobacteria and diatoms at different concentrations of nutrients. Changes in macroinvertebrate structure were evidenced mainly by the availability of cyanobacteria and diatoms. During the rainy season, herbivorous macroinvertebrates densities showed an inversely proportional relation to high cyanobacteria densities. Cyanobacteria have morphology, toxin production, and mucosaccharide sheaths that make them impalpable to herbivores by reducing the population density of consumers. During the dry period, the density of herbivorous macroinvertebrates increased, coinciding with diatom dominance. Diatoms are used as food sources for many consumers because they arc rich in protein and fatty acids. In the eutrophic environments studied, the changes in the trophic relationships of the communities were evident according to nutrient concentrations during the seasons. The grazing effect of herbivores on microalgae was insufficient to cause any significant reduction, while high levels of nutrients caused bottom-up changes in the highest levels of the food web, demonstrating that this complex interaction is influenced by several factors.;[do Nascimento Filho, Silvano Lima| de Melo Junior, Mauro| Moura, Ariadne do Nascimento] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Rua D Manoel de Medeiros,S-N Dois Irmaos, BR-52171030 Recife, PE, Brazil| [de Franca, Elton Jose] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Unidade Acad Serra Talhada, Ave Gregorio Ferraz Nogueira, BR-56909535 Serra Talhada, PE, Brazil;Moura, AD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Rua D Manoel de Medeiros,S-N Dois Irmaos, BR-52171030 Recife, PE, Brazil.;silvano.biouast@gmail.com| ejfranca@hotmail.com| mmelojunior@gmail.com| ariadne_moura@hotmail.com;De Melo Junior, Mauro/AAH-1012-2019| MOURA, ARIADNE/AAC-5339-2020| Franca, Elton J/N-9300-2016| Junior, Mauro Melo/A-6241-2013;Franca, Elton J/0000-0002-6719-4757| Junior, Mauro Melo/0000-0002-7963-1205;Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia de Pernambuco (FACEPE) [PBPG-09952.05/14]| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [304237/2015-9];The Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia de Pernambuco (FACEPE) (Process de No: PBPG-09952.05/14) to the first author and to the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) for the productivity grant research granted to the last author (Process de No 304237/2015-9).;;74;3;3;1;20;E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG;STUTTGART;NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY;1863-9135;;;FUND APPL LIMNOL;Fundam.

However, these studies are limited to single species tests and there is still a research gap about the behaviour of microalgal communities under this environmental stressor. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the negative effects of CO2 under an ecologically realistic scenario. To achieve this objective, two types of toxicity tests were developed| i) single toxicity tests and ii) multispecies toxicity tests, in order to evaluate the effects on each species as well as the interspecific competition. For this purpose, three microalgae species (Tetraselmis chuii, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Nannochloropsis gaditana) were exposed to two selected pH levels (7.4, 6.0) and a control (pH 8.0). The pH values were choosen for testing different scenarios of CO2 enrichment including the exchange atmosphere-ocean (pH 7.4) and natural or anthropogenic sources of CO2 (pH 6.0). The effects on growth, cell viability, oxidative stress, plus inherent cell properties (size, complexity and autofluorescence) were studied using flow cytometry (FCM). Results showed that T. chuii was the most resistant species to CO2 enrichment with less abrupt changes in terms of cell density, inherent cell properties, oxidative stress and cell viability. Although P. tricornutum was the dominant species in both single and multispecies tests, this species showed the highest decrease in cell density under pH 6.0. Effects of competence were recorded in the multispecies control (pH 8) but this competence was edipsed by the effects of low pH. The knowledge of biological interactions made by different microalgae species is a useful tool to extrapolate research data from laboratory to the field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One of the most important factors affecting the marine environment is the well-known process called ocean acidification. Also, there are other natural or anthropogenic processes that produce an enrichment of CO2 in the marine environment (CO2 leakages from Carbon Capture and Storage technologies (CCS), organic matter diagenesis, volcanic vents, etc). Most of the studies related to acidification of the marine environment by enrichment of CO2 have been focused on short-term experiments. To evaluate the effects related to CO2 enrichment, laboratory-scale experiments were performed using the marine microalgae Tetraselmis chuii and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Three different pH values (two treatments - pH 7.4 and 6.0 - and a control - pH 8.0) were tested on the selected species across four consecutive generations. Seawater was collected and exposed to different scenarios of CO2 enrichment by means of CO2 injection. The results showed different effects depending on the species and the generation used. Effects on T. chuii were shown on cell density, chlorophyll-a and metabolic activity, however, a slight adaptation across generations was found in this last parameter. P. tricornutum was more sensitive to acidification conditions through generations, with practically total growth inhibition in the fourth one. The conclusions obtained in this work are useful to address the potential ecological risk related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 on the marine ecosystem by using consecutive generations of microalgae.

However, the development of full-scale implementations requires overcoming microalgae inhibition by high ammonia concentrations and low light transmittances affecting photosynthesis. This study evaluated the potential of microalgae-based reactors supplied with red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) at low intensity (660 nm and 15 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) to treat food waste digestate. LED reactors were compared with control reactors exposed to solar radiation. From a range of species in the inoculum, Chlorella vulgaris showed high adaptation to both lighting regimes and digestate environmental conditions, characterized by a C:N:P ratio of 74:74:1. Removal efficiencies for control and LED reactors were 84.0% and 95.8% for soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 89.4% and 53.0% for ammonia, respectively. Approximately 50% of ammonia in control reactor and 15% in LED reactor was lost from the systems, whereas 17% and 36% of ammonia was transformed to organic nitrogen in control and LED reactors, respectively. Low-intensity LEDs maintained microalgae growth in levels similar to solar radiation and supported efficient digestate treatment, showing a potential for further application in optimization of full scale reactors at a relatively low energy cost.;[Torres Franco, Andres Felipe| Passos, Fabiana| de Lemos Chernicharo, Carlos Augusto| Mota Filho, Cesar Rossas] Fed Univ Minas Gerais DESA UFMG, Dept Sanitat & Environm Engn, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil| [Araujo, Scarlet da Encarnacao| Figueredo, Cleber Cunha] Fed Univ Minas Gerais ICB UFMG, Inst Biol Sci, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil;Mota, CR (corresponding author), Fed Univ Minas Gerais DESA UFMG, Dept Sanitat & Environm Engn, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.;cesar@desa.ufmg.br;Passos, Fabiana/L-1432-2016| Torres, Andres/AAH-1821-2020| Mota, Cesar/I-4365-2013;Passos, Fabiana/0000-0001-7501-988X| Torres Franco, Andres Felipe/0000-0002-9279-5343| Figueredo, Cleber/0000-0002-6248-1327| Mota, Cesar/0000-0002-3538-8856;Minas Gerais State Agency for Research and Development - (FAPEMIG)Minas Gerais State Research Foundation (FAPEMIG) [APQ-02752-14]| National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [141428/2016-3];Authors acknowledge the Minas Gerais State Agency for Research and Development - (FAPEMIG) for funding support through project 694 - FAPEMIG - APQ-02752-14 and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for the scholarship 141428/2016-3.;;25;3;3;1;15;IWA PUBLISHING;LONDON;ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND;0273-1223;1996-9732;;WATER SCI TECHNOL;Water Sci.

In some outdoor systems, the temperature can be higher than 35 degrees C, which is lethal for several algae. Prospecting microalga from thermal environments seems to be a good option. Therefore, the objective of this work was to isolate a microalga (Acutodesmus obliquus (Turpin) Hegewald and Hanagata) from thermal water and evaluate its cultivation productivity in Bold Basal Medium (BBM) and in lower cost alternative media. One alternative medium contained only the main growth ingredients (DAF), the other included these same ingredients with the addition of wastewater from the purification of grease-based raw materials (DAF + OGR). Microalga biodiesel productivity was also compared with the biodiesel yield of soybean, which is one of the main raw materials currently used for biodiesel production. The microalga was shown to provide biomass with similar productivity using the three different culture media in log phase. The microalga exhibited biodiesel productivity from 46 to 61 times higher than soybean| using 5.5-7.2% of the water and 1.6-2.2% of the land required for soybean cultivation to produce the same amount of biodiesel. The DAF + OGR medium, which costs 29% of the cost of the BBM medium, proved to be an efficient alternative medium compared to other in biomass productivity. Levels of tri-unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids from A. obliquus microalga were slightly higher than those standardized by EN14214, requiring that the biodiesel be mixed with antioxidants.;[D'Alessandro, Emmanuel Bezerra| Soares, Aline Terra| Pereira, Juliao| Antoniosi Filho, Nelson Roberto] Univ Fed Goias, Inst Quim, Campus 2, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil;D'Alessandro, EB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Goias, Inst Quim, Campus 2, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil.;dalessandro.e.b@gmail.com;Filho, Nelson Roberto Antoniosi/R-8297-2019| D'Alessandro, Emmanuel/I-2662-2017| , Aline/C-2774-2017;Filho, Nelson Roberto Antoniosi/0000-0002-3067-0385| D'Alessandro, Emmanuel/0000-0003-4294-5793| , Aline/0000-0001-7627-8891;Financier of Studies and Projects (FINEP)| Foundation of Research Support (FUNAPE) of the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) [01.10.0457.00]| National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [407556/2013-3];The infrastructure used in this project was funded by a project grant from the Financier of Studies and Projects (FINEP) and Foundation of Research Support (FUNAPE) of the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC), Process No. 01.10.0457.00.

The shallow lake system of Len double dagger ois Maranhenses (SLLM) is a unique coastal ecosystem in northeast Brazil found interspersed in a field of sand dunes. Organisms in these tropical lakes are constantly exposed to high temperatures and solar irradiance. Yet, little is known about the diversity of culturable microalgae in this aquatic ecosystem. This study reports the use of flow cytometry with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate single microalgae cells/coenobia from five lakes in SLLM, accessing the efficiency of this isolation technique with two types of culture media. To retrieve the highest diversity of culturable microalgae, planktonic, benthic, and epiphytic samples were collected and processed by FACS. The diversity of microalgae in natural lake communities was described by morphology-based taxonomy. Isolates of the most abundant phylum established in cultures (Chlorophyta) were characterized by gene sequencing (18S rDNA). A total of 3072 microalgal cells/coenobia were sorted into 96-well plates. From these, 945 wells presented algal growth (31% success rate). Based on morphological diversity and adaptability to culture conditions, a set of 171 strains were selected to be incorporated in a culture collection. Microalgae present in the lakes belonged to six phyla, with four of them represented in the cultured strains. Our sampling strategy coupled with FACS isolation retrieved a fairly large number and diversity of microalgal strains with minimum isolation effort from a unique coastal environment. The monoclonal cultures established in this study offer new opportunities for basic and applied research on microalgae biotechnology.;[Fistarol, Giovana O.| Hargreaves, Paulo I.| Walter, Juline M.| Viana, Tatiana V.| Gomes, Piter D.

However, efficient protein secretion depends on numerous factors that are not always known, and rapid development of protein secretion depends on efficient reporters. This study aimed to compare the secretion efficiency of seven fluorescent proteins (FPs)-mTagBFP, mCerulean, Emerald, CrGFP, cOFP, tdTomato, and mCherry-which are photoactive across the visible light spectrum in the microalgal expression system, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. To fully compare the efficiency of FPs, three expression vectors-a non-secreting vector used as a control and two secreting vectors employing arylsulfatase 1 (ARS1) signal peptide-were used. Up to 94 transformants for each construct were evaluated to better determine the secretion detection efficiency and variability of each FP construct. Fluorescence measurements of all FPs in the whole culture and supernatant were conducted using a microplate reader. Furthermore, we observed fluorescence of six FPs, among the seven tested, in the secretory pathway by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The results indicated that orange and red FPs are the most suitable for this photosynthetic pigment-rich organism, but the FP reporter for secretion should be selected carefully, since some may be deleteriously modified, as observed in the case of tdTomato, in our study. Overall, cOFP and mCherry performed admirably with a high fluorescence signal to noise ratio (S/N > 6) for all constructs as compared to that of the wild type auto-fluorescence, and showed a high positive rate of transformants (> 75%). This FP may play an important role in protein secretion studies, supporting the development of this potential expression system based on microalgae.;[Dutra Molino, Joao Vitor| Monteiro de Carvalho, Joao Carlos] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Biochem & Pharmaceut Technol, Av Prof Lineu Prestes 580,Bl 16, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, Brazil| [Mayfield, Stephen] Univ Calif San Diego, Calif Ctr Algae Biotechnol, Div Biol Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA;Mayfield, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Calif Ctr Algae Biotechnol, Div Biol Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;smayfield@ucsd.edu;;;U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-EE0008246]| Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/18224-2];This work was supported in part by U.S. Department of Energy grant DE-EE0008246 and by the grant 2013/18224-2, Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP).

Two groups of boars (n=3 each) were fed during 75 days either a commercial diet (control), or the same diet supplemented with omega-3 PUFA from the heterotrophic microalgae Schizochytrium sp. (120g/kg). Sixteen ejaculates were collected per boar. Some sperm kinetics parameters were inferior for supplemented than for control boars (p<.05): distance average path| distance in both curved and straight line| velocity average path, velocity in both curved and straight line| and amplitude of lateral head displacement. Spermatozoa from supplemented boars presented lower mitochondrial functionality, but greater membrane fluidity compared to the control group (p<.01). Membrane and acrosome integrity, production of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation did not differ (p>.05). Serum cholesterol levels were greater (p<.05) for supplemented than for control boars at the 30th and 60th d of supplementation, but levels of triglycerides and IGF-1 did not differ (p>.05). Compared to the control, spermatozoa of supplemented boars were slower, travelled shorter distances and presented impaired energy metabolism, but their greater membrane fluidity may potentially favour their cryopreservation.;[Andriola, Y.

The efficiency of the dissolution provided by the carbonation column and the carbon release to the atmosphere through the movement of the paddle wheels were also investigated. Dissolution efficiencies of 50%, 48% and 46% were obtained in the HRPs of 20, 30 and 40cm depth, respectively. These differences can be attributed to the time necessary to recirculate the volume of each HRP in the carbonation column. The volumetric mass transfer coefficients regarding the release to the atmosphere were 0.0007, 0.0005 and 0.0004min(-1) for the 20, 30 and 40cm HRPs, respectively. The carbon assimilation by the biomass was inversely proportional to depth, with values of 90%, 72% and 68% for the 20, 30 and 40cm HRPs, respectively. Chlorophyll-a concentration was also higher in the 20cm HRP. The radiation attenuation at the beginning of the operation was similar among the treatments, resulting in a greater fraction of the pond depth with available radiation in the 20cm HRP.;[Couto, E.

The pollutants conversion in parallel with microalgal sludge formation results in a renewable feedstock for bioproducts production that potentially reduces the cost of wastewater treatment. The experiments have been performed in a bubble column bioreactor, operating at 25 degrees C, pH 7.5, 100 mg/L of initial inoculum, absence of light and flow rate per unit volume (Q/V) of 1.0 VVM (volume of air per volume of culture per minute). Thereby, the kinetic parameters of cell growth, substrate consumption, analysis of microalgal sludge composition and the biodiesel quality properties have been realized. The nutrient cycling by Phormidium autumnale in wastewater has presented high removal efficiencies of pollutants. The generated microalgal sludge shows predominance of saturated fatty acids, indicates the potential of its use as a suitable lipid input for biodiesel synthesis. The lipid-extracted microalgae (LEM) showed high content of free amino acids, minerals and pigments. The heterotrophic microalgae cultivation in wastewater has demonstrated to be capable of removing pollutants and, simultaneously, producing biofuel and being a potential source for animal feeding from microalgal sludge, contributing, therefore, to the multi-purpose microalgal bioprocess development.;[dos Santos, Alberto Meireles| dos Santos, Aline Meireles| Sartori, Rafaela Basso| Queiroz, Leila Zepka| Barin, Juliano Smanioto| Jacob-Lopes, Eduardo] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Roraima Ave 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil;Jacob-Lopes, E (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Roraima Ave 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.;albertomsrs@gmail.com| alinemeirelessm@hotmail.com| rafaa.sartori@hotmail.com| lqz@pq.cnpq.br| juliano@ufsm.br| jacoblopes@pq.cnpq.br;Barin, Juliano Smanioto/AAX-2430-2020;Barin, Juliano Smanioto/0000-0002-8351-3287;;;;45;3;3;1;6;DESALINATION PUBL;HOPKINTON;36 WALCOTT VALLEY DRIVE,, HOPKINTON, MA 01748 USA;1944-3994;1944-3986;;DESALIN WATER TREAT;Desalin.

The potential of Chlorella sp. growth in photobioreactor under controlled conditions was also investigated. Low lipid content (up to 3%) was observed in both cases. The composition of both oils showed high amount of fatty acids and fatty acid based compounds, however there are also other non-fatty acid based lipids. Density and viscosity of biodiesel from biosolid oil were determined and the results showed that these physico-chemical properties do not match the specification required for biodiesel. The results showed that sewage sludge from Samambaia treatment station (DF, Brazil) and Chlorella sp. cultivated under the conditions described in this work are not potential sources of fatty material for biodiesel production.;[Pinho, David M.

For instance, nanotechnology-based fertilizers, such as the candidate hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanoparticles (Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)), can potentially increase the food production by rationally supplying phosphorous to crops, although with inferior mobility in the environment (when compared to the soluble counterparts), avoiding eutrophication. Nonetheless, the widespread consumption of nanofertilizers also raises concern about feasible deleterious effects caused by their release in the environment, which ultimately imposes risks to aquatic biota and human health. Nanoparticles characteristics such as size, shape, surface charge and chemical functionality strongly alter how they interact with the surrounding environment, leading to distinct levels of toxicity. This investigation aimed to compare the toxicity of different HAp nano particles, obtained by two distinct chemical routes, against algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, which composes the base of the aquatic trophic chain. The as synthesized HAp nanoparticles obtained by co-precipitation and co-precipitation followed by hydrothermal method were fully characterized regarding structure and morphology. Toxicity tests against the microalgae were carried out to evaluate the growth inhibition and the morphological changes experienced by the exposition to HAp nanoparticles. The results showed that high concentrations of coprecipitated HAp samples significantly decreased cell density and caused morphological changes on the algal cells surface when compared to HAp obtained by hydrothermal method. HAp nanoparticles obtained with dispersing agent ammonium polymethacrylate (APMA) indicated negligible toxic effects for algae, due to the higher dispersion of HAp in the culture medium as well as a reduced shading effect. Therefore, HAp nano particles obtained by the latter route can be considered a potential source of phosphorous for agricultural crops in addition to reduce eutrophication.;[Pereira, Flavia F.| Paris, Elaine C.| Bresolin, Joana D.| Foschini, Milene M.| Ferreira, Marcos D.| Correa, Daniel S.] Embrapa Instrumentacaco, LNNA, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| [Pereira, Flavia F.| Ferreira, Marcos D.| Correa, Daniel S.] Fed Univ Sao Carlos UFSCar, Ctr Exact Sci & Technol, PPG Biotec, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil;Correa, DS (corresponding author), Embrapa Instrumentacaco, LNNA, BR-13560970 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;daniel.correa@embrapa.br;Correa, Daniel/B-5660-2008;Correa, Daniel/0000-0002-5592-0627| Bresolin, Joana/0000-0002-2867-4395| Pereira, Flavia/0000-0002-4862-8273| Paris, Elaine Cristina/0000-0001-8599-9674;FAPESP from BrazilFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/17528-8, 2014/16789-5]| CNPq from BrazilNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| CAPES from BrazilCAPES| MCTI-SisNano, Rede Agronano-Embrapa from Brazil;The authors are grateful to FAPESP (process no 2013/17528-8, 2014/16789-5), CNPq, CAPES, MCTI-SisNano, Rede Agronano-Embrapa from Brazil for financial support.;;53;3;4;2;45;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;0147-6513;1090-2414;;ECOTOX ENVIRON SAFE;Ecotox.

In this study, potential prebiotic oligosaccharides were obtained frommicroalgal biomass via phosphoric acid hydrolysis under moderate pH and thermopressurization conditions. The biomass extracted from a gaseous effluent treatment system at a local steakhouse was compared with the commercial microalga Chlorella vulgaris and cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis. These biomasses were microscopically and physico-chemically analyzed, subjected to a 32 factorial design, and partially hydrolyzed by thermopressurization. The resulting oligosaccharide samples were used as carbon sources for culturing the probiotic microorganisms Bifidobacterium animalis and Lactobacillus casei. These oligosaccharides allowed for beneficial bacterial growth and the production of short-chain fatty acids, such as lactic and acetic acids. This research indicates the feasibility of potential prebiotic oligosaccharide production from microalgal biomass and simultaneously adds value to this by-product of gaseous waste treatment.

The basal mixed diets consisted of a formulated diet, supplemented with dried microalgae biomass of A. gracilis (1.5 g kg(-1)) and H. pluvialis (1.5 g kg(-1)). The live food diets contained zooplankton was cultured in open ponds, associated with microalgae. All the microalgae were cultured in the laboratory. No mortality was observed with any experimental diets. Fish performance results showed significant differences (P < 0.05) between the basal diet (BD) and the live food diet. The higher weight and total length were observed with mixed diets (BD + H. pluvialis and BD + A. gracilis). The mixed diets promoted more intense values of chroma (Cab*), lightness (L*) and redness (a*) to H. eques. Diaphanosoma birgei (Cladocera) represented more than 32% of zooplankton ingested by ornamental fish in live food (zooplankton and zooplankton + microalgae), and Argyrodiaptomus furcatus (Copepoda) was the species most ingested by H. eques in live food dietary treatment zooplankton. The feeding behaviour observed in the laboratory as well as the food preferences of H. eques was dependent on the zooplankton composition present in the used open ponds. This study showed that diets with microalgae and zooplankton were able to enhance the pigmentation of H. eques, being a good tool to benefit the culture management of this species.;[Berchielli-Morais, Flavia Almeida| Sipauba-Tavares, Lucia Helena] Sao Paulo State Univ, Aquaculture Ctr, Lab Limnol & Plankton Prod, Jaboticabal, Brazil| [Kochenborger Fernandes, Joao Batista] Sao Paulo State Univ, Aquaculture Ctr, Ornamental Fish Lab, Jaboticabal, Brazil;Sipauba-Tavares, LH (corresponding author), Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Aquaculture Ctr, Lab Limnol & Plankton Prod, BR-14884900 Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil.;sipauba@caunesp.unesp.br;;Sipauba Tavares, Lucia Helena/0000-0002-2241-0241| Fernandes, Joao Batista/0000-0003-3886-8561;CAPESCAPES| FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [09/51946-6];The authors would like to thank CAPES for providing a scholarship to the first author, FAPESP for providing financial support (09/51946-6) and the colleagues of the Limnology and Plankton Production Laboratory for their instrumental assistance in field sampling and laboratory analysis.

This biomolecule has been studied for its application in enzymatic systems of CO2 capture and sequestration. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate the production of carbonic anhydrase in the culture of marine and freshwater microalgae and to monitor the growth in terms of biomass and pH. The marine microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta, Tetraselmis suecica, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Isochrysis galbana and Nannochloropsis oculata, and the freshwater microalgae Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus were cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks at 25 degrees C. The freshwater microalga that had the highest enzyme production was C. vulgaris: its maximum activity was 44.0 U/L. Among the marine microalgae, P. tricornutum stood out as the best producer, with a maximum activity of 19.9 U/L. In terms of specific activity, the highest values were obtained from D. tertiolecta (44.6 U/g) and P. tricornutum (24.5 U/g).

Botryococcus braunii, a green microalga that can accumulate more than half of its dry weight as hydrocarbons, is one of the most important examples. This microorganism grows in colonies and there has been no reliable viability protocol reported for this species as yet. Knowing the number of dead cells in cultures is essential for the development of efficient bioprocesses such as non-destructive extraction procedures (milking) to obtain lipid soluble substances frommicroalgal biomass. Our study presents a simple colorimetricmethod to determine the proportion of living to dead cells in cultures, based on the uptake ofmethylene blue in solution by dead B. braunii cells. The main parameters influencing this process were investigated and used to develop a protocol.

The stages were as follows: conventional operation (stage I), 12 h aeration in P2 (stage II), and 18 h aeration in P2 (stage III). The results showed the possibilities for treating landfill leachate, presenting an average efficiency of 75% for both filtered biochemical oxygen demand and ammonium. At the end of stage III, the ammonium concentration was 6 mg L-1, which is lower than that established by Brazilian regulations for wastewater discharge (CONAMA 430/2011). The aeration applied in P2 led to a change in the microbial consortia during the second and third stage, which influenced the quality of the final effluent.

However, this compound can be toxic to fish, being a strong oxidant. Moreover, there is no consistent information in the literature about its toxicity to non-target organisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity (LC50|96h) of potassium permanganate for tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, and to determine its toxic effects on nontarget organisms using ecotoxicological assays performed with the microcrustacean Ceriodaphnia dubia and with the green microalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. The results showed that the concentration of 1.81 mg L-1 of potassium permanganate caused acute toxic effect in tilapia fingerlings. The ecotoxicological assays demonstrated that concentrations above 0.12 mg L-1 can cause chronic toxic effects on non-target organisms, indicating possible deleterious effects on the food chain of the aquatic ecosystem that may receive the discharge of effluents released by fish cultures treated with this chemotherapy. All toxic concentrations determined in this study were below those recommended in the literature for the use of this chemotherapy in fish cultures, demonstrating that this type of therapy should be more carefully considered in order to avoid damage to the treated fish and to the environment.

The highest biomass was located on the bottom section of tall plants, presumably due to their relatively longer contact with creek water and associated phytoplankton, and their closer proximity to marsh sediments with associated benthic microalgae, both recruitment sources for epiphytes. Dead plants left standing from the previous year's growth cycle had higher epiphytic biomass than living plants, which occurred mostly in late spring through fall. Epiphytic biomass was highest in the winter (mean of 1.77 mg chl a (m(2) marsh)(-1)) and lowest in the summer (mean of 0.34 mg chl a (m(2) marsh)(-1)). Because phytoplankton and Spartina production are lowest in the winter, the results emphasize the relative importance of epiphytes to growth of herbivores in this season.;Univ S Carolina, Marine Sci Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USA| Univ S Carolina, Baruch Marine Lab, Belle W Baruch Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Georgetown, SC 29442 USA| Marine Resources Res Inst, S Carolina Dept Nat Resources, Hollings Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA| S Carolina Honors Coll, Columbia, SC 29208 USA| Marine Sci Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USA;Jackson, G (corresponding author), Inst Estud Mar Almirante Paulo, Dept Oceanog, Rua kiota 253, BR-29230000 Arraial Do Cabo, RJ, Brazil.;mgabi@biol-sc.edu;;;;;;89;3;3;0;23;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1559-2723;1559-2731;;ESTUAR COAST;Estuaries Coasts;DEC;2006;29;6B;;;;;1212;1221;;10.1007/BF02781821;;;10;Environmental Sciences| Marine & Freshwater Biology;Environmental Sciences & Ecology| Marine & Freshwater Biology;200JO;WOS:000248759900012;;;;;2021-01-01

To our best knowledge, for the first time, the influence of light period on the treatment of wet-end and finishing leather wastewaters with a micro-algae consortium containing mainly Tetraselmis sp. was investigated. In this work, a microalgae consortium present the ability to grow well in this kind of tannery wastewater and was used for reducing nitrogen, phosphorus, ammonium, chemical and biochemical oxygen demands. Additionally, the wastewater presents high turbidity, which has an influence on the penetration of light, during the cultivations. Therefore, the influence of the illumination period was also studied: continuous light (24-light), 12 h light/dark (12-light) and without light (0-light)| in addition to the influence of compositions, 50% and 75% of raw wastewater. The maximum concentration of biomass in the wastewater was observed in the 24-light culture: 50R50S (1.40 gL(-1)) and 75R25S (1.04 gL(-1)), with maximum removals of total nitrogen (71.74%), total phosphorus (97.64%), total organic carbon (31.35%), chemical oxygen demand (56.70%), biological oxygen demand (20.68%) and ammonium (100%). These results show that this microalgae consortium is a promising alternative treatment for wastewaters of the leather wet-end and finishing steps. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Two additional treatments were included as controls: a chemoautotrophic (Q) treatment with a C:N ratio of 7.69:1 and a heterotrophic (H) treatment with a C:N ratio of 13:1. Differences in growth and weight gain were observed among the photoautotrophic treatments and Q and H treatments (p < .05). An increase in nitrates in all photoautotrophic treatments suggests that a chemoautotrophic pathway naturally occurred. For O. niloticus carcasses, the protein (>50.9%) and crude lipid (>23.1%) levels were not significantly different among treatments (p > .05). For the Q treatment, the highest crude protein (42.6%) and crude lipid (1.1%) levels in biofloc were observed during the nursery phase (p < .05). Correlation analyses between the amino acid composition in O. niloticus and that of the feed highlighted deficiencies with regard to methionine, lysine and threonine content despite the high r(2) value obtained (.9078). In addition, deficiencies in arginine, lysine and taurine were observed in the biofloc (r(2) = .7265). In Part II, the physicochemical characterization of nutrient residuals and O. niloticus BFT aquaculture integration with hydroponic horticulture in non-recirculated systems is described.;[Fimbres-Acedo, Yenitze E.| Magallon-Servin, Paola| Servin-Villegas, Rosalia| Magallon-Barajas, Francisco J.] Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, La Paz, Bcs, Mexico| [Garza-Torres, Rodolfo] Unidad Nayarit Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico| [Emerenciano, Mauricio G.

Thus, the selection of suitable locations according to their climatic conditions is extremely important to develop technically and economically viable processes. This study aimed to assess the influence of geographic position and local climate on the microalgae culture performance in photobioreactors, as a strategy to map potential regions for commercial-scale microalgae production. Six extreme positions of Brazil were chosen to represent their respective climates in the four seasons of the year. RESULTS The climatic variables considered were temperature, light irradiance, and photoperiod. In terms of both biomass and lipid production in an annual overview, the results showed that tropical climates and low latitudes favor the microalgae culture. The highest annual average biomass productivity (0.278 g L-1 d(-1)) and annual average lipid productivity (0.056 g L-1 d(-1)) were recorded in Boa Vista-RR (02 degrees 49 ' 12 '' N), in summer. CONCLUSION The geographic position and the local climate are decisive criteria in the performance of these processes, being able to increase up to three and four times the biomass productivity and lipid productivity, respectively.

Data on chemical composition, fatty acids, volatile compounds, and carotenoid profiles were determined. In parallel, are provided the antioxidant capacity (reducing capacity - RC and reactive oxygen species deactivation - ORAC) of aqueous, lipophilic, and carotenoid extracts isolated from microalgae biomass. Both species have similar compounds in their biomass. However, S. obliquus was statistically different with a lower saturated fatty acid (STF) followed by higher mono (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) content, also showed higher antioxidant potential for acetone extract and isolated carotenoids. On the other hand, P. autumnale aqueous extract showed high RC and ORAC. The significance of the experimental data was determined using the t-test (p < 0.05) based on the Statistica 7.0 software. These findings led us to explore the microalgae S. obliquus in an in vivo experimental model. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, the fitting of the experimental data by live kinetic models (first-order, second-order, modified Gompertz, Logistic, and two-substrate) was evaluated. Thermal pretreatment increased the methane yield of single microalgae and WAS digestion by approximate to 44 and by approximate to 52%, respectively. The results also showed that up to 60% of WAS can be co-digested with microalgae without impairing the methane yield, producing up to 338 mL(CH4) g(VS)(-1). Data from digestion of non-pretreated microalgae and WAS were well described by all kinetic models, but digestion of thermally pretreated microalgae, WAS, and their co-digestion mixtures, was best fitted by means of a two-substrate model, indicating that after pretreatment it is necessary to take into account the contribution of both rapidly and slowly biodegradable fractions.

Most lichen microalgae can tolerate drastic dehydration-rehydration (D/R) conditions| however, their mechanisms of D/R tolerance are scarcely understood. We tested the hypothesis that D/R-tolerant microalgae would have flexible CWs due to species-specific CW ultrastructure and biochemical composition, which could be remodelled by exposure to cyclic D/R. Methods Two lichen microalgae, Trebouxia sp. TR9 (TR9, adapted to rapid D/R cycles) and Coccomyxa simplex (Csol, adapted to seasonal dry periods) were exposed to no or four cycles of desiccation [25-30 % RH (TR9) or 55-60 % RH (Csol)] and 16 h of rehydration (100 % RH). Low-temperature SEM, environmental SEM and freeze-substitution TEM were employed to visualize structural alterations induced by D/R. In addition, CWs were extracted and sequentially fractionated with hot water and KOH, and the gel permeation profile of polysaccharides was analysed in each fraction. The glycosyl composition and linkage of the main polysaccharides of each CW fraction were analysed by GC-MS. Key Results All ultrastructural analyses consistently showed that desiccation caused progressive cell shrinkage and deformation in both microalgae, which could be rapidly reversed when water availability increased.

However, the use of microalgae for biofuels is still a challenge due to the intense energy use and the generation of a significant amount of biomass residues in the process. In order to analyze the environmental impacts of different technological processes for the production of biodiesel from microalgae, several studies have been published making use of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, which allows the recognition of the process bottlenecks and supports the identification of alternatives for a more efficient use of the feedstock. Therefore, in this study, a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) is compiled, based on real pilot-scale process data, which was scaled-up to a microalgae biomass industrial plant for biofuel production. Values of energy, nutrients, water, and materials consumption are used to create an inventory of inputs and outputs for biomass cultivation and biodiesel production, in order to acquire data to conduct a complete LCA modeling in future studies. According to this model, to produce 1 kg of biodiesel it is necessary about 12 kg of dried algae biomass. This study supports the decision-making process in biofuel production to promote the development of sustainable pilot and large-scale algae-based industry, through the identification of critical factors.

Carbohydrates from microalgae are mostly composed by glucose and some pentose-derived polymers that must be hydrolyzed to be efficiently used. When enzymatic hydrolysis is applied a pretreatment is required. Sonication/ultrasonication is one of the most promising methods, and in this paper the influence of pretreatment time, sonication intensity and biomass concentration was validated, and the energy consumed in the process compared as well. Sonication intensity had the major role on the enzymatic accessibility. Pretreatment time can be used to decrease hydrolysis time. More than 90% of hydrolysis efficiency was reached when higher amplitude (sonication intensity) and pretreatment time were used. The applied energy influenced indirectly the hydrolysis process. The best saccharification/energy relation was reached when 50% of amplitude for 25 min was applied, obtaining 91% of hydrolysis yield and spending 2.4 MJ/kg of dry biomass.

An important cultivation parameter is light wavelength (lambda). It can affect microalgal growth, lipid yield, and fatty acid composition. In the current study, the mixture design was used as an alternative to model the influence of the lambda on the Dunaliella salina lipid productivity. The illumination was considered to be the mixture of different lambda (the light colors blue, red, and green). All experiments were performed with and without sodium acetate (4 g/L), as carbon source, allowing the identification of the impact of the cultivation regimen (autotrophic or mixotrophic). Without sodium acetate, the highest lipid productivity was obtained using blue and red light. The use of mixotrophic cultivations significantly enhanced the results. The optimum obtained result was mixotrophic cultivation under 65% blue and 35% green light, resulting in biomass productivity of 105.06 mgL(-1)day(-1), a lipid productivity of 53.47 mgL(-1)day(-1), and lipid content of 50.89%. The main fatty acids of the oil obtained in this cultivation were oleic acid (36.52%) and palmitic acid (18.31%).;[Bredda, Eduardo Henrique| da Silva, Aneirson Francisco| Silva, Messias Borges] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Engn Fac Guaratingueta, Dept Prod Engn, Guaratingueta, SP, Brazil| [Silva, Messias Borges| Molgero da Ros, Patricia Caroline] Univ Sao Paulo, Engn Sch Lorena, Dept Chem Engn, BR-12602810 Lorena, SP, Brazil;da Ros, PCM (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Engn Sch Lorena, Dept Chem Engn, BR-12602810 Lorena, SP, Brazil.;patriciadaros@usp.br;Da Ros, Patricia C M/E-2939-2015| Silva, Messias Borges/F-5959-2012;Da Ros, Patricia C M/0000-0001-6176-1848| Silva, Messias Borges/0000-0002-8656-0791| Bredda, Eduardo Henrique/0000-0003-2046-6791;FAPESP (Sao Paulo State Research Foundation)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2016/18909-3]| CAPES (Brazilian Federal Agency for Postgraduate Education)CAPES [001];This work was supported by FAPESP (Sao Paulo State Research Foundation| process 2016/18909-3) and CAPES (Brazilian Federal Agency for Postgraduate Education) - Finance Code 001.;;45;2;2;2;6;TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC;PHILADELPHIA;530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA;1082-6068;1532-2297;;PREP BIOCHEM BIOTECH;Prep.

This study aimed to evaluate the ability of microalgae phenolic extracts to inhibit trichothecene production by Fusarium genus and thereby identify parameters that can promote a new technology to avoid contamination of crops by mycotoxins. The microalgae phenolic acids (Spirulina sp. and Nannochloropsis sp.) were extracted with methanol, clarified and resuspended in water. The in vitro experiment involved adding the phenolic extract from each microalga (40 mu g/mL) to Petri dishes containing culture medium and previously sterilized wheat grains, with subsequent inoculation of an isolate belonging to the F. graminearum species complex. The control was cultured with sterile water. Treatment with the fungicide tebuconazole (0.6 mg/mL) was also performed. Petri dishes were incubated at 25 degrees C, with a light/dark photoperiod of 12-12 h. After 168 h, the samples were extracted by the adapted QuEChERS method| the trichothecenes (nivalenol, deoxynivalenol and acetylates) were identified and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. When the phenolic extracts from microalgae were applied, the characteristic peak of nivalenol was not detected, suggesting total inhibition, whereas, the nivalenol content increased (15%) in the presence of tebuconazole. Both microalgae phenolic extracts also had a promising effect on the inhibition of deoxynivalenol, with no detection (Nannochloropsis sp. extract) and 62% reduction (Spirulina sp. extract). The application of the fungicide tebuconazole increased the deoxynivalenol concentration. Both microalgae phenolic extracts and tebuconazole decreased the detection of acetylates. Thus, phenolic extracts from microalgae were more efficient than tebuconazole as antifungal and antimycotoxigenic agents in cultures in vitro.;[Scaglioni, Priscila Tessmer| Garcia, Sabrina de Oliveira| Badiale-Furlong, Eliana] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Lab Micotoxinas & Ciencia Alimentos, Escola Quim & Alimentos, Programa Posgrad Engn & Ciencia Alimentos, Ave Italia,Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil| [Scaglioni, Priscila Tessmer] Univ Fed Pelotas UFPel, Lab Controle Contaminantes Biomat, Ctr Ciencias Quim Farmaceut & Alimentos, Programa Posgrad Bioquim & Bioprospeccao, Ave Eliseu Maciel S-N, BR-96160000 Pelotas, RS, Brazil;Scaglioni, PT (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Lab Micotoxinas & Ciencia Alimentos, Escola Quim & Alimentos, Programa Posgrad Engn & Ciencia Alimentos, Ave Italia,Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.| Scaglioni, PT (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pelotas UFPel, Lab Controle Contaminantes Biomat, Ctr Ciencias Quim Farmaceut & Alimentos, Programa Posgrad Bioquim & Bioprospeccao, Ave Eliseu Maciel S-N, BR-96160000 Pelotas, RS, Brazil.;priscilascaglioni@gmail.com| dqmebf@furg.br;Scaglioni, Priscila Tessmer/J-8378-2013| Furlong, Eliana Badiale/AAE-4008-2019;Scaglioni, Priscila Tessmer/0000-0003-4420-1229| de Oliveira Garcia, Sabrina/0000-0002-1743-1654;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [472633/2012];This study was funded by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (472633/2012).;;44;2;3;2;11;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0963-9969;1873-7145;;FOOD RES INT;Food Res.

Cell wall limits bio-accessibility of microalgal intracellular compounds, demanding pretreatment to improve methane yield. Two pretreatments are evaluated at 75 degrees C using residual heat: thermal (1 bar) and thermomechanical (20 bar), which increased biogas production in 40% and 159%, respectively. Thermomechanical pretreatment is coupled to the following downstream processing cases: (i) biomethane| (ii) bioelectricity| (iii) biomethane with enhanced oil recovery| (iv) bioelectricity with enhanced oil recovery and (v) pressurized anaerobic digestion (6 bar) for biomethane with enhanced oil recovery. Processes are compared in three dimensions: energy, economic and carbon footprint. Such a framework including upstream and downstream processes, besides comparison of atmospheric and pressurized anaerobic digestion, with in-depth economic analysis, configures the main novelties of this work. Resource utilization efficiency metrics point advantage of pressurized anaerobic digestion case, while indicate biomethane production as less efficient than bioelectricity. When carbon dioxide post-combustion capture and enhanced oil recovery are applied to abate bioelectricity emissions, bioelectricity loses competitiveness to biomethane due to high energy penalties. Sensitivity of Net Present Value to varying carbon taxation (increasing costs), Capture & Trade mechanism and enhanced oil recovery (adding revenues) show superior resilience of biomethane with enhanced oil recovery. In base scenario conditions, where 30US$/GJ electricity is applied, maximum biomass costs to economic feasibility for cases (i) to (v) are 50, 21, 100, 5 and 83US$/t (dry-basis), respectively. Priced at 50US$/GJ, the bioelectricity production frontier to feasibility starts at biomass costs approximate to 150US$/t.;[Brigagao, George Victor| Wiesberg, Igor Lapenda| Pinto, Juliana Leite| Fernandes Araujo, Ofella de Queiroz| de Medeiros, Jose Luiz] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Escola Quim, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil;Araujo, ODF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Escola Quim, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;george.victor@poli.ufrj.br| igorwg@ufrj.br| juliana.pinto@eq.ufrj.br| ofelia@eq.ufrj.br| jlm@eq.ufrj.br;de Medeiros, Jose L./G-3342-2015| de Queiroz Fernandes Araujo, Ofelia/E-5247-2013;de Medeiros, Jose L./0000-0001-9099-4288| de Queiroz Fernandes Araujo, Ofelia/0000-0003-4041-7161;Petrobras S.A.

We report the characterization of microalgae extracts via traveling wave ion mobility-mass spectrometry (TWIM-MS) by two different analysis strategies. First, the extracts were analyzed by direct infusion electrospray ionization (ESI) with no previous chromatographic separation (DI-ESI-TVVIM-MS). Second, the samples were screened for metabolites and lipids using an untargeted high-throughput method that employs ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) using data-independent analysis (DIA) MSE (UHPLC-HDMSE). Sixteen different microalgae biomasses were evaluated by both strategies. DI-ESI-TWIM-MS was able, via distinct drift times, to set apart different classes of metabolites, with the differences in the profiles of each microalga readily evident. With the UHPLC-HDMSE approach, 1251 different compounds were putatively annotated across 16 samples with 210 classified as lipids. From the normalized abundance for each annotated compound category, a detailed profiling in terms of metabolites, lipids, and lipid classes of each sample was performed. The reported workflow represents a powerful tool to determine the most suitable biotechnological applications for a given alga type and may allow for real-time monitoring of the algae composition distribution as a function of growth conditions, feedstocks, and the like. The determination of collision cross section results in improved confidence in the identification of triacylglycerols in samples, highly applicable to biofuels production. The two analysis strategies explored in this work offer powerful tools for the biomass industry by aiding in the identification of ideal strains and culture conditions for a specific application, saving analysis time and facilitating identification of a large number of constituents at once.;[Fasciotti, Maira| Costa, Ingrid C.

S.;Dehydration of microalgae Spirulina platensis in a rotary drum with insert bed;POWDER TECHNOLOGY;English;Article;Spirulina platensis| Rotary drum| Inert bed| DEM simulation;GRANULAR FLOW| BIOMASS;Among the various species of microalgae, Spirulina platensis has recently attracted attention from food and pharmaceutical industries due to its high contents of protein and bioactive compounds. Due to its high moisture content, a major challenge in the use of this microalga is its perishability. In this work, we investigated the use of a non-conventional rotary dryer (with an inert bed) for drying microalga Spirulina platensis. We quantified the effects of air temperature, feed rate, rotation speed, and filling degree of the inert particles on process performance. We then performed an optimization study using the Differential Evolution algorithm to identify the operating conditions that maximize process yield. We also performed a DEM simulation to gain a better understanding of the fluid dynamics. The results prove that this non-conventional system offers an interesting alternative for expanding use of this biomass, when performed under appropriate operating conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty-four Holstein cows [130.3 +/- 15.4 d in milk, and 30.8 +/- 0.543 kg/d of milk yield (mean +/- standard error)] were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design experiment to evaluate the following treatments: control diet, without addition of ALG| and increasing levels of ALG [2, 4, and 6 g/kg of dry matter (DM)]. The ALG decreased DM intake and increased total-tract DM apparent digestibility. A tendency was observed for a quadratic effect on total-tract NDF digestibility by ALG inclusion, with peak value of the quadratic response at 4.13 g/kg of DM dose. Moreover, ALG increased ruminal pH and decreased acetate and total volatile fatty acid concentrations. Fat-corrected milk and energy-corrected milk were quadratically affected, and a tendency for a milk yield effect was observed when ALG levels increased, whereas maximal yields were observed with intermediate doses. Milk fat, protein, and lactose concentrations were diminished, whereas productive efficiency was improved by the increase of ALG levels. Saturated fatty acid proportions were decreased, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acid proportions were increased when A LG was fed. There was low DHA transfer into milk| however, ALG inclusion decreased C18:0, C18:1 cis9, C18:2 cis-9,12, and C18:3 cis-9,12,15 proportions, and increased C18:2 cis-9,trans-11, C18:1 trans-9, and C18:1 trans-11 proportions. Gross energy intake was decreased, whereas no effect was observed on digestible, metabolizable, or net energy intake. The ALG inclusion quadratically affected the microbial protein synthesis, with maximal enhancement at 3.24 g/kg of DM dose, and also increased serum cholesterol concentration. Under the conditions of this experiment, the inclusion of ALG in diets for mid-lactating dairy cows decreased feed intake and increased nutrient digestibility, improving productive efficiency and modifying milk fatty acid profile. Estimated intermediate doses (1.22 to 2.90 g/kg of DM) of DHA-rich ALG may be beneficial to milk, fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk yields, and is recommended for dairy cows.;[Marques, Alija A.| Del Valle, Tiago A.| Ghizzi, Lucas G.| Zilio, Elissandra M.

The study focused on the characterization of odorant profile from raw wastewater, on the deodorization of the compounds and the formation of the volatile organic compounds as co-products of the process. The results showed that emissions from the wastewater treatment plant are composed of 4 sulfur, 7 aldehydes, 1 furan, 2 hydrocarbon, 10 terpenes, 7 alcohols, 2 ketones, 3 amines, and 4 phenolic compounds. The levels of these volatile organic compounds from wastewater, regardless of polarity range, decreased with concomitant formation of other compounds, usually with desirable odor description, as residence time increased. A total of 15 compounds of various chemical structures (such as aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, esters, terpenes, acids, and nitrogen compounds) ware formed. Regardless of these organic classes, three main odor categories (fruity, spicy, and resinous) emerged. Based on these results, we found the potential of the microalgae-based processes for odor abatement of the meat industry in parallel to production of desirable compounds.;[Vieira, Karem Rodrigues| Pinheiro, Pricila Nass| Santos, Andrieli Borges| Cichoski, Alexandre Jose| de Menezes, Cristiano Ragagnin| Wagner, Roger| Zepka, Leila Queiroz| Jacob-Lopes, Eduardo] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Roraima Ave 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil;Jacob-Lopes, E (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Roraima Ave 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.;merakvieira@gmail.com| pricila.nass@gmail.com| andri31@gmail.com| cijoale@gmail.com| cristiano.ufsm@gmail.com| rogerwag@gmail.com| lqz@pq.cnpq.br| ejacoblopes@gmail.com;Wagner, Roger/I-1538-2014| Cichoski, Alexandre/ABG-2193-2020;Wagner, Roger/0000-0002-6176-7913| ;National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| Brasil Foods, Inc;Funding for this research has been provided by Brasil Foods, Inc and National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).;;45;2;2;5;19;DESALINATION PUBL;HOPKINTON;36 WALCOTT VALLEY DRIVE,, HOPKINTON, MA 01748 USA;1944-3994;1944-3986;;DESALIN WATER TREAT;Desalin.

In order to optimize the ethyl conversion, different temperatures (46.7-68.1 degrees C) and pressures (59.5-200.5 bar) were applied a central composite design rotational (CCDR) obtaining the high conversion (74.39%) at 50 degrees C and 180 bar. The molar ratio also was investigated showing conversions similar to 90% using a molar ratio of 1:24 (oil:ethanol). From the best transesterification conditions, 50 degrees C, 180 bar, 20% enzymatic concentration, and 1:24 oil:ethanol molar ratio were obtained with success 98.9% conversion in 7 h of reaction. The enzyme reuse maintained its activity for three successive cycles.

Microalgae can be used as an alternative treatment to reach the required effluent quality. However, only robust and fast growing microalgae species are required in order to ensure stable and efficient nutrient removal under the conditions existing in wastewater treatment plants. Consequently, maintaining a stable microalgae community adapted to this environment becomes a key issue. In this work, a local microalgal strain was isolated from an anaerobic digester effluent (ADE). Microalgal growth was defined as the isolation criteria. The isolated microalgae were identified by molecular techniques as Chlorella sorokiniana (strain S12/S13/S16). Nutrient removal capacity from the ADE was assessed for the isolated strain by cultivation on ADE in repeated batch mode. Growth was limited by phosphorus, which reached removal efficiencies close to 100%. Under such conditions, biomass productivity and growth rate were barely enhanced with CO2-enriched air not compensating the extra cost of CO2 addition. Finally, in order to close the process scheme, the methane potential of the isolated C. sorokiniana was assessed. The methane production capacity was 376mLCH(4)g(-1) volatile solids, similar to values reported for other microalgae species. The novelty of this work lies in the isolation of a robust local microalgal strain that ensures a high nutrient removal capacity from ADE. The efficiency and stability of the nutrient removal process might be enhanced by isolation and controlled growth of local, robust, and also fast-growth microalgae species.;[Tapia, Camila| Vilchez, Carlos| Cuaresma, Maria] CIDERTA, Algal Biotechnol Grp, Parque Huelva Empresarial S-N, Huelva 21007, Spain| [Tapia, Camila| Vilchez, Carlos| Cuaresma, Maria] Univ Huelva & Marine Int Campus Excellence CEIMAR, Fac Sci, Parque Huelva Empresarial S-N, Huelva 21007, Spain| [Tapia, Camila| Jeison, David| Ruiz, Gonzalo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Escuela Ingn Bioquim, Av Brasil 2085, Valparaiso, Chile| [Fermoso, Fernando G.| Serrano, Antonio] CSIC, Inst Grasa, Seville, Spain| [Torres, Alvaro] Univ La Frontera, Chem Engn Dept, Temuco 01145, Chile| [Rivas, Mariella] Univ Antofagasta, CICITEM, Bioenergy & Environm Sustainabil, Antofagasta, Chile| [Rivas, Mariella] Univ Antofagasta, Algal Biotechnol & Sustainabil Lab, Marine Sci & Biol Resources Fac FACIMAR, Antofagasta, Chile;Cuaresma, M (corresponding author), CIDERTA, Algal Biotechnol Grp, Parque Huelva Empresarial S-N, Huelva 21007, Spain.| Cuaresma, M (corresponding author), Univ Huelva & Marine Int Campus Excellence CEIMAR, Fac Sci, Parque Huelva Empresarial S-N, Huelva 21007, Spain.;maria.cuaresma@dqcm.uhu.es;Vilchez, Carlos/ABD-6507-2020| Vilchez, Carlos/G-3536-2012| Jeison, David/M-5313-2017| Serrano, Antonio/E-8260-2017| Cuaresma, Maria/C-3561-2015| Serrano, Antonio/K-3407-2019;Vilchez, Carlos/0000-0002-8164-1672| Jeison, David/0000-0002-2234-8257| Cuaresma, Maria/0000-0003-2183-9342| Serrano, Antonio/0000-0002-4615-5038| Rivas Alvarez, Mariella Odette/0000-0002-8638-9525;7th Framework Programme of European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [PIRSES-GA-2011-295165];This work was supported by the 7th Framework Programme of European Union, under the framework of the Algaenet Project (Grant number PIRSES-GA-2011-295165).;;42;2;2;0;14;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0921-8971;1573-5176;;J APPL PHYCOL;J.

In in vitro experiments, the Nannochloropsis and Spirulina extracts inhibited fungal biomass by 34 and 25%, respectively, compared with the untreated control. This effect was confirmed by a reduction in ergosterol production (-80% for Nannochloropsis and -75% for Spirulina) and in DON content (-97% for Nannochloropsis and -62% for Spirulina). In field experiments, application of the fungicide prothioconazole and prothioconazole + tebuconazole resulted in control of Fusarium head blight (FHB) and foliar disease, leading to a significant increase in grain yield (+13%) and a reduction in DON content (-46%) compared to the untreated control. The application of MPE at wheat flowering reduced the severity of FHB compared with the control (-35% for Spirulina and -39% for Nannochloropsis). However, the MPE did not significantly control foliar diseases (Septoria tritici blotch) and therefore did not enhance the grain yield. Moreover, no effect in reducing the DON content in comparison to the control was observed in the field. In view of that, the use of MPE in wheat fields as real alternatives to conventional fungicides requires the discovery of solutions to empower their persistence and efficacy.;[Scaglioni, P.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the growth and kinetic parameters of six microalgae, and the moisture and lipid contents and fatty acids profiles of the biomasses harvested at the end of each cultivation. The microalgae were isolated in the Mid-Western Region of Brazil cultivated in open pond systems. It was observed that among the six microalgae used in this work, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata presented the higher maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)) (0.12 day(-1)). The microalgae Coelastrum sp. and P. subcapitata were the ones with the highest lipid contents, with approximately 20% of dry mass. The main fatty acid accumulated in these conditions was palmitic acid, with percentages of 59 to 69% for all microalgae evaluated.

The study lasted 63 days and was carried out in tanks with a working volume of 40L, at a stocking density of 10 fish per experimental unit and a mean initial weight of approximately 1.86 g. The water quality variables showed no significant difference between treatments, especially total ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen, which were within acceptable levels for culture of the species. The variables of zootechnical performance were not affected by the different inoculation densities of the microalgae, achieving a final mean weight of approximately 21 g for all treatments, and survival rates greater than 80%. The weekly inoculation densities of the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris therefore had no influence on the growth of tilapia fingerlings cultured in a biofloc system.;[de Araujo, Marcele Trajano| Mascena Braga, Italo Felipe| Cisneros, Santiago Vega| Bezerra Cabral da Silva, Suzianny Maria| Galvez, Alfredo Olivera| Correia, Eudes de Souza] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco UFRPE, Dept Pesca & Aquicultura, Rua Dom Manuel Medeiros S-N, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil;de Araujo, MT (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco UFRPE, Dept Pesca & Aquicultura, Rua Dom Manuel Medeiros S-N, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil.;marcele_trajano@hotmail.com;;Silva, Suzianny/0000-0002-7571-3465;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq);The authors would like to thank the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) for their financial support.;;52;2;2;0;0;INST PESCA;SAO PAULO;AV FRANCISCO MATARAZZO, 455, SAO PAULO, SP 05001-900, BRAZIL;0046-9939;1678-2305;;BOL INST PESCA;Bol.

This work tested microalgae consortium growth originating from a deactivated effluent treatment decanter of a complete tannery (beamhouse to finished leather) for the treatment of wastewater of a tannery processing wet-blue leather to finished leather. It was initially evaluated the growth of the microalgae consortium in the three effluents diluted in 50% distilled water: raw effluent (50RE50W), effluent after primary coagulation/flocculation (50PE50W), and effluent after primary and secondary biological treatment (50BE50W). After 16 days of cultivation, the 50PE50W presented the highest biomass concentration (1.77 g L-1). The highest removal values for effluents 50RE50W, 50PE50W and 50BE50W were 51.02%, 99.90%, 82.88%, and 91.75% for chemical oxygen demand (COD), N-NH3, TKN, and P-PO4-, respectively. It was verified low levels of nutrient removal in the raw effluent (100RE), since the consortium was not able to grow in this medium. Finally, at concentrations of 25RE75BE (25% raw effluent diluted with 75% effluent after the biological treatment) and 50RE50B (50% raw effluent diluted with 50% effluent after the biological treatment), effective removal values were reached. Biomass growth concentration up to 1.3 g L-1 and removal values for N-NH3, TKN, P-PO4, COD, total organic carbon (TOC) and biological oxygen demand (BOD5), of 99.90%, 79.36%, 87.82%, 14.26%, 35.82%, and 42.86%, respectively, were reached in 50RE50B.;[Campos Pena, Aline de Cassia| Bertoldi, Crislaine Fabiana| da Fontoura, Juliana Tolfo| Gutterres, Mariliz] Fed Univ Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Chem Engn Dept, Chem Engn Postgraduated Program, Lab Leather & Environm Studies, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil| [Trierweiler, Luciane Ferreira] Fed Univ Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Chem Engn Dept, Chem Engn Postgraduated Program, Grp Intensificat Modeling Simulat Control & Optim, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil;Pena, ADC (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Chem Engn Dept, Chem Engn Postgraduated Program, Lab Leather & Environm Studies, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.;campos@enq.ufrgs.br;Bertoldi, Crislaine F./F-4918-2017| Gutterres, Mariliz/H-7986-2016| Pena, Aline/AAM-3704-2020| Trierweiler, Luciane Ferreira/AAK-6245-2020| Trierweiler, Luciane/T-8439-2017;Bertoldi, Crislaine F./0000-0001-6156-3139| Gutterres, Mariliz/0000-0001-8939-2888| Pena, Aline/0000-0002-6007-9609| Trierweiler, Luciane/0000-0003-4497-7334;Brazilian Federal Agency for the Scholarship (CNPQ) National Council for Scientific and Technological Development| Agency Financier of Studies and Projects (FINEP);We would like to thank the scholarships provided by Brazilian Federal Agency for the Scholarship (CNPQ) National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, Agency Financier of Studies and Projects (FINEP) for the financial support by the public MCTI/FINEP CT-HIDRO 01/2013 and also we are grateful to Tannery CBC Leather Ltda for the samples of wastewater.;;25;2;2;1;2;INST TECNOLOGIA PARANA;CURITIBA-PARANA;RUA PROF ALGACYR MUNHOZ MADER 3775-CIC, 81350-010 CURITIBA-PARANA, BRAZIL;1516-8913;1678-4324;;BRAZ ARCH BIOL TECHN;Braz.

This thermal water microalga was isolated and cultivated in two media with different concentrations of nutrients to evaluate the maximum biomass yield, fatty acids, and lutein profiles. From the less nutrient medium to the more nutrient medium, the biomass productivity was 31-71 mg L-1 day(-1), the percentage of fatty acids was 15.3-7.7%, the percentage of lutein was 0.46-1.22%, respectively. Media with a lower concentration of nutrient favor fatty acid production, but negatively affect the lutein and biomass productions. In comparison with higher plants, E. planctonicus produced up to 9 times more fatty acids than soybean and up to 11 times more lutein than Marigold flowers, which are the conventional source of these substances. The microalgae E. planctonicus is an excellent source of lutein that could be exploited by the food and pharmaceutical industries. Moreover, E. planctonicus is a good source of biomass and fatty acids. All these characteristics found in just one microalga species can make the process of bioproducts production cheaper.;[D'Alessandro, Emmanuel Bezerra| Soares, Aline Terra| da Costa, Dayane Cristina| Silva Neto, Habdias de Araujo| Antoniosi Filho, Nelson Roberto] Univ Fed Goias, Inst Chem, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil| [Fernandes, Valeria de Oliveira] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Human & Nat Sci, BR-29060900 Vitoria, ES, Brazil;D'Alessandro, EB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Goias, Inst Chem, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil.;dalessandro.e.b@gmail.com;D'Alessandro, Emmanuel/I-2662-2017| Filho, Nelson Roberto Antoniosi/R-8297-2019| , Aline/C-2774-2017;D'Alessandro, Emmanuel/0000-0003-4294-5793| Filho, Nelson Roberto Antoniosi/0000-0002-3067-0385| de Araujo Silva-Neto, Habdias/0000-0002-5613-5727| , Aline/0000-0001-7627-8891;Foundation of Research Support (FUNAPE) of the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) [01.10.0457.00]| National Council for Scientific and Technological Development also funded this project (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [407556/2013-3]| CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [312019/2013-0, 141501/2013-8];This work was supported by Financier of Studies and Projects (FINEP) and Foundation of Research Support (FUNAPE) of the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC), process No. 01.10.0457.00| National Council for Scientific and Technological Development also funded this project (CNPq), process No. 407556/2013-3.

Isolated from a Microalgae Consortium for Tannery Wastewater Treatment;JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF LEATHER TECHNOLOGISTS AND CHEMISTS;English;Article;;EFFLUENT| ALGAE;Microalgae have been the subject of several studies in the wastewater treatment field due to their ability for the removal of various nutrients, organic load and to be a clean and economical way to treat pollutants. The effluents from leather finishing processing steps contain chemical pollutants due to the use of dyes, surfactants, toxic metals, emulsifying agents, retanning agents, oils, pigments, resins, among other chemicals added. In this work, the isolated microalgae Tetraselmis sp. was obtained from a microalgae consortium and evaluated for their ability for the treatment effluents collected from a tannery. The growth of microalgae biomass in these effluents in mixotrophic cultivation was analysed, as well as, the capacity of removal of total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC), total carbon (TC), inorganic carbon (IC), ammonia (N-NH3), phosphorus (P-PO4), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD). The removal values observed for the 50R50T (50% raw/50% treated effluent) and 75R25T (75% raw/25% treated effluent) concentrations were 96.59% and 99.81% for phosphorus, 99.90% and 89.2% for ammoniacal nitrogen, 89.06% and 54.78% for TN, 40.46% and 43.54% for COD, 59.24% and 57.90% for TOC, 32.70% and 44.73% for BOD, respectively. The microalgae Tetraselmis sp. showed notable growth in mixotrophic cultivation, and the efficient removal of the controlled parameters indicate an enormous potential for application in tannery wastewater treatment.;[Campos Pena, Aline de Cassia| Schaumloffel, Livia de Souza| Gutterres, Mariliz] Fed Univ Rio Grande Sul UFRGS, Chem Engn Dept, Lab Leather & Environm Studies LACOURO, Av Luiz Englert S-N, BR-90040040 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil| [Trierweiler, Luciane Ferreira] Fed Univ Rio Grande Sul UFRGS, Chem Engn Dept, Grp Intensificat Modeling Simulat Control & Optim, Av Luiz Englert S-N, BR-90040040 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil;Pena, ADC (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande Sul UFRGS, Chem Engn Dept, Lab Leather & Environm Studies LACOURO, Av Luiz Englert S-N, BR-90040040 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.;alinecamposer@eng.ufrgs.br;Trierweiler, Luciane Ferreira/AAK-6245-2020| Schaumloffel, Livia/AAV-1927-2020| Gutterres, Mariliz/H-7986-2016;Schaumloffel, Livia/0000-0003-4725-8220| Gutterres, Mariliz/0000-0001-8939-2888;Brazilian Federal Agency for the Scholarship (CAPES)CAPES| FINEP (MCTI/FINEP) [CT-HIDRO 01/2013];Thanks to the scholarships provided by Brazilian Federal Agency for the Scholarship (CAPES).

To improve the cost/benefit ratio of microalgae mass production, many culture systems have been built and upgraded. Mathematical modeling the growth of different species in different systems has become an efficient and practical tool to understand both physical and biochemical phenomena in play during algae cultivation. In addition, growth modeling can guide design changes that lead to process optimization. In the present work, growth of the green microalga Scenedesmus obliquus was modeled in a hybrid photobioreactor that combines the characteristics of tubular photobioreactors (TPB) with thin-layer cascades (TLC). The system showed productivity greater than 8.0gm(-2) day(-1) (dry mass) for CO2-fed cultures, and the model proved to be an accurate representation of experimental data with R-2 greater than 0.7 for all cases under variable conditions of temperature and irradiance to determine subsystem efficiency. Growth modeling also allowed growth prediction relative to the operating conditions of TLC, making it useful for estimating the system given other irradiance and temperature conditions, as well as other microalgae species.;[Tramontin, Deise P.| Quadri, Marintho B.] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Lab Sistemas Porosos, Campus Trindade, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [Gressler, Pablo D.| Rorig, Leonardo R.] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Lab Ficol, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [Derner, Roberto B.] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Lab Cult Algas, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [Pereira-Filho, Jurandir] Univ Vale Itajai, UNIVALI, Lab Oceanog Quim, Itajai, SC, Brazil| [Radetski, Claudemir M.] Univ Vale Itajai, UNIVALI, Lab Remediacao Ambiental, Itajai, SC, Brazil;Tramontin, DP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Lab Sistemas Porosos, Campus Trindade, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;deiseparol@gmail.com;Filho, Jurandir Pereira/K-2375-2012| Derner, Roberto Bianchini/F-1766-2015| Rorig, Leonardo/S-7191-2017;Filho, Jurandir Pereira/0000-0002-7166-458X| Derner, Roberto Bianchini/0000-0001-6474-1287| Rorig, Leonardo/0000-0003-2244-9223| Radetski, Claudemir M./0000-0002-8537-1497;Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Engenharia Quimica (POSENQ - UFSC)| Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Biotecnologia e Biociencias (PPGBB - UFSC)| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| CAPES - Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel SuperiorCAPES;Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Engenharia Quimica (POSENQ - UFSC)| Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Biotecnologia e Biociencias (PPGBB - UFSC)| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico| CAPES - Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior;;60;2;2;0;36;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0006-3592;1097-0290;;BIOTECHNOL BIOENG;Biotechnol.

Furthermore, the flocculation efficiency by means of optical density (OD) was also evaluated. The results indicated that FeCl3 and Al-2(SO4)(3) were highly effective for the recovery of microalgal biomass, greater than 95%. Though, when FeCl3 was used, there was an immediate change in color to the biomass after the orange colored salt was added, typical with the presence of iron, which may compromise the biomass use according to its purpose and Al-2(SO4)(3) is associated with the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease, restricting the application of biomass recovered through this process for nutritional purposes, for example. Therefore, it was observed that sodium hydroxide is an efficient flocculant, promoting recovery around 93.5% for the ideal concentration of 144mg per liter. It had the best environmental profile among the compared flocculant agents, since it did not cause visible changes in the biomass or compromise its use and had less impact in relation to acidification, eutrophication, global warming and human toxicity, among others. Thus, the results indicate that it is important to consider both flocculation efficiency aspects and environmental impacts to identify the best flocculants on an industrial scale, to optimize the process, with lower amount of flocculant and obtain the maximum biomass recovery and decrease the impact on the extraction, production, treatment and reuse of these chemical compounds to the environment. However, more studies are needed in order to evaluate energy efficiency of the process coupled with other microalgal biomass recovery technologies. In addition, studies with natural flocculants, other polymers and changes in pH are also needed, as these are produced in a more sustainable way than synthetic organic polymers and have the potential to generate a biomass free of undesirable contaminants.;[Scherer, Marisa D.| Oliveira, Amanda C.| Selesu, Nelson F.

Biomolecules are phenotypic expressions that can be useful in the taxonomy of microorganisms. In this scenario, the present study used the spectra of organic compounds (mainly proteins) of whole cells obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technique as a tool to differentiate freshwater coccoid green microalgae of the family Selenastraceae at the species and strains levels. Firstly, a test to choose the matrix and sample preparation method that could result in higher signal-to-noise ratio was performed with the species Ankistrodesmus fusiformis and Coelastrum sphaericum. The best spectra were obtained using alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA) and matrix suspension method, which were used for chemotaxonomic analysis of 18 microalgal strains belonging to 12 different species. Spectra of microalgae cells were collected in two different mass ranges, from 0.4 to 2.0 kDa and from 2.0 to 20.0 kDa. Each strain yielded unique spectra with a good resolution of peaks and reproducibility, which was used for the cluster analyses. The dissimilarity analysis showed that it was possible to distinguish microalgal strains and species based on the obtained spectra. Geographic differences for the genus Selenastrum were evidenced in both mass ranges analyzed. Furthermore, our data corroborated some previous studies with Selenastraceae, using molecular markers, regarding to the polyphyly of the genus Monoraphidium. The spectra collected at higher masses contained more significant information for the taxonomy of green coccoid microalgae, allowing a better distinction between the genus Ankistrodesmus and Monoraphidium.

Therefore, they also have the potential to be used as bioadsorbents for removal of toxic metals. Interaction of Hg(II) with live Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was investigated for the first time by stripping chronopotentiometry, enabling the quantification of the reactive metal fractions in presence of the microalgae. This approach allowed the computation of the Hg(II) fraction able to dissociate from metal-cell surface complexes due to the concentration gradient imposed by the deposition potential applied to the working electrode. Equilibrium was reached in 120 min. Biosorption isotherms at pH 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 were fitted using the Langmuir-Freundlich equation, showing the highest biosorption capacity, (3.3 +/- 0.9) mmol g(-1), at pH 4.0. The mass balance of Hg(II) in filtered solution plus in digested microalgae (102 +/- 8%) indicated that most Hg (II) was retained in the cells instead of being released to the surrounding environment, an interesting feature for biosorbents. However, for initial Hg concentrations > 20 mu mol L-1 the determined Hg(II) concentrations in presence of the cells were 2 to 6 times higher than those determined in the filtered solutions, suggesting a partial lability of the surface-bound Hg(II) which should be considered in bioremediation technologies.;[do Nascimento, Fernando H.| Rigobello-Masini, Marilda| Masini, Jorge C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Dept Quim Fundamental, Av Prof Lineu Prestes 748, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil| [Domingos, Rute F.] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inst Phys Globe Paris, UMR CNRS 7154, F-75205 Paris 05, France| [Pinheiro, Jose P.] Univ Lorraine, UMR CNRS 7360, LIEC ENSG, 15 Ave Charmois, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France;Masini, JC (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, Dept Quim Fundamental, Av Prof Lineu Prestes 748, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.;jcmasini@iq.usp.br;Masini, Jorge Cesar/C-9069-2012| Rigobello-Masini, Marilda/ABF-3919-2020;Masini, Jorge Cesar/0000-0002-0496-9009| Rigobello-Masini, Marilda/0000-0001-5402-441X;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [475554/2009-4, 304178/2009-8]| Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2012/08065-1];This work was funded by grants 475554/2009-4 and 304178/2009-8 from the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) and grant 2012/08065-1 (fellowship to F.H.N.) from the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP).;;40;2;2;0;15;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2211-9264;;;ALGAL RES;Algal Res.;JUN;2017;24;;A;;;;347;353;;10.1016/j.algal.2017.04.027;;;7;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;EZ6YA;WOS:000404864600037;;;;;2021-01-01

Phytopathogenic strains of the genus Pythium cause billion dollar losses all over the world on natural and crop species. Searching for eco-friendly algaecides and fungicides, we analyzed the effects of acetone extracts of A. glabra leaves on the algae Rhaphidocelis subcapitata (Korshikov) and on the oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum (Edson). We evaluated ten extract concentrations for each organism -0 to 400 mg L-1 for algae and 0-1000 mu g disc(1) for oomycete. The results showed no effect on algae up to 75 mg L-1, but a significant inhibitory effect at 125 mg L-1 and above, which reduced the growth rate and the final biomass of the algae. Extract concentrations above 200 mg L-1 were completely inhibitory. The half maximal inhibitory concentration for 72 and 96 h of exposure to our crude extracts are comparable to those obtained with commercial fungicides and herbicides used in aquatic ecosystems. The P. aphanidermatum inhibition concentrations have effects comparable to fungicides as Cycloheximide and Bifonazole. Some substances isolated from the extracts are described as antifungals, which could explain part of anti-oomycete activity. Our results highlight the importance of searching bioactive compounds from plants.;[Rocha, Giseli S.] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Hidrobiol, SP-310,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| [Matsumoto, Reginaldo S.| Lombardi, Ana Teresa| Lima, Maria Ines S.] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Bot, SP-310,Km 235,Caixa Postal 676, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| [Rocha, Giseli S.] WasserCluster, Biolog Stn Lunz, Dr Carl Kupelwieser Promenade 5, A-3293 Lunz Am See, Austria;Rocha, GS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Hidrobiol, SP-310,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.| Rocha, GS (corresponding author), WasserCluster, Biolog Stn Lunz, Dr Carl Kupelwieser Promenade 5, A-3293 Lunz Am See, Austria.;swertsbio@gmail.com;;;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [302837/20124]| Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2009/15511-5];Maria da Graca Gama Melao is acknowledged for providing the sonicator and laboratory facilities.

The LM of the microalgae was transesterified (alkaline), the fatty profile evidenced qualitatively and quantitatively by gas chromatography (GC) and used alternatively and quantitatively by TG. The thermal results showed protein content in biomass and TAG in microalgal ML. Chromatographic (GC) data revealed high content of saturated fatty acids (approximately 70 %) being the eicosanoic acid its major constituent (33.7 %), which resulted in a high thermal stability of biodiesel.

A.;The use of microalgae and their culture medium for biogas production in an integrated cycle;WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;English;Article;alkalinity| bioenergy| methane production| volatile fatty acids| vinasse digestion;IMPACT;Vinasse is a residue produced in large quantities as a sub-product of ethanol production. Anaerobic digestion of vinasse can yield large amounts of biogas, but often difficulties arise in maintaining stable operation, due to the acidity of the material (which has a pH between 3.5 and 5) and a strong tendency to further acidification. Anaerobically digested vinasse can be used as part of a culture medium for microalgae cultivation, for the production of biodiesel and other compounds, whilst the excess CO2 produced in the ethanol fermentation can be used to stimulate algal growth. During algae cultivation, the pH of the culture medium has a strong tendency to increase| therefore, recycling of the spent culture medium or the concentrated algae suspension to the anaerobic digester treating vinasse was considered an option for pH stabilization there. Batch tests, however, showed that alkalinity of the spent culture broth, in spite of its high pH, is too low (only 350 mgCaCO(3)L(-1)) to help stabilise the pH of vinasse digestion. Alkalinity of the algae suspension is higher and digestion of a mixture of vinasse and a suspension of algae results in efficient biogas production, but still the alkalinity is insufficient to stabilise the pH in a range suitable for methanogenic microorganisms| hence, the addition of additional alkalinity, for instance as sodium bicarbonate or urea, remains necessary.;[Formagini, E.

Nine replica experiments were performed. The growth was monitored daily through the culture medium optic density and kept constant up to the end of the exponential phase. The network training followed a full 3 3 factorial design, in which the factors were the number of days in the entry vector (3,5 and 7 days), number of clusters (10, 30 and 50 clusters) and internal weight softening parameter (Sigma) (0.30, 0.45 and 0.60). These factors were confronted with the sum of the quadratic error in the validations. The validations had 24 (A) and 18 (B) days of culture growth. The validations demonstrated that in long-term experiments (Validation A) the use of a few clusters and high Sigma is necessary.

The feasibility of using coal as a fuel depends upon reducing emissions of gas when it is burnt, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur oxides (SOx), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The removal of CO2 with microalgae may be one of the most efficient ways of reducing this gas, without the need for radical changes in the world's energy supply and production methods. Spirulina sp LEB-18 and Scenedesmus obliquus LEB-22 were cultivated in serial tubular photobioreactors, with the aim of measuring the potential of CO2 biofixation and the resistance of the microalgae to SO2 and NO. Spirulina sp. and S. obliquus had CO2 biofixation scores of 0.27 and 0.22 g L-1 d(-1), respectively. Both microalgae were resistant to SO2 and NO, and grew during the 15 d they were cultivated, which proves that using microalgae is an efficient method of biofixation of CO2 emitted when fossil fuels are burnt.;[Morais, Michele G.| Radmann, Elisangela M.| Costa, Jorge A.

Natural substrate is more suitable for biomass and productivity estimates as well as biodiversity assessment because it contains the communities that are typical of the environment. We present a new gadget for epilithic microalgae sampling (GEMS) that allows sampling in situ when it is impossible to remove the substrate from the river bed. The sampler consists of an acrylic box with a 25 cm diameter opening on its base that allows access to the substrate. This gadget can he used in shallow plan bedrock streams and it keeps the sample area isolated as much as possible minimising losses and contamination.

This water run through an open channel and was a mixture of reclaimed wastewater from a nearby wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and run-off from the different agricultural fields in the area. Most of the compounds studied are usually not fully eliminated during conventional wastewater treatment, which justifies the need to investigate alternative treatment strategies. A total of 21 of these compounds were detected in the irrigation water. Benzotriazoles were only partially removed after the micmalgae treatment, with elimination rates similar to those of conventional WWTPs. The UV filter benzophenone-3 (BP3) showed variable removals, ranging from no elimination to 51%, whereas 4-methylbenzilidenecamphor (4MBC) was completely eliminated. Regarding pharmaceuticals, average removals were higher, in the range of 60-100%, with the exception of the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (46%) and sulfapyridine, which was not removed. Despite the low biomass productivity of the PBR, parameters such as the size of the reactors, the specific mixed cultures developed and the high temperatures and pH in the closed system may account for the overall good results, The efficiency and sustainability of these systems make them a solid, feasible treatment choice.;[Vassalle, Lucas| Uggetti, Enrica| Diez-Montero, Ruben| Garcia, Joan| Garcia-Galan, M.

Acid-catalyzed transesterification using hydrochloric acid was developed for biodiesel production. Biodiesel was purified by column chromatography using one of the two green solvents as eluents. The highly ecological biodiesel quality was compared to the biodiesel produced using chloroform as co-solvent. A 33 factorial design was conducted to optimize the production of fatty acid methyl esters, being the independent variables investigated: solvent and catalyst volume, solvent and catalyst ratio (methanol:co-solvent:hydrochloric acid), and temperature, with a reaction time of 150 min. Biodiesel production was mainly influenced by temperature increase. The achieved yields using cyclopentyl methyl ether, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and chloroform were 71-92%, 67-91%, and 61-76%, respectively. The fatty acid methyl esters profile of biodiesel produced with 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and cyclopentyl methyl ether consisted of approximately 45% polyunsaturated components. The biodiesel obtained was within the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. The replacement of fossil solvents used in direct transesterification of biomass with a green solvent resulted in a further ecological biodiesel production process towards a circular bioeconomy.

In many cases the cells can generate high biomass yield under mixotrophy, which is highly desirable for future massive applications of microalgae biomass as industrial feedstock. However, there is no complete understanding of the molecular physiology of microalgae in mixotrophy. Therefore, we performed a time-series analysis of the proteome and transcriptome of Chlorella vulgaris during the transition from autotrophy to mixotrophy under continuous light, and then to heterotrophy in darkness in controlled bioreactor conditions. The results from biomass and cell growth characterization demonstrated that under mixotrophic growth the cells have enhanced growth rate, and transcriptomics data showed overexpressed genes related to chromosome organization, DNA-repair, and DNA replication. Moreover, our proteomics data revealed differentially expressed proteins and overrepresentation of proteins related to translation mechanism. The transcriptomics and proteomics analysis also indicated that the expression of genes of the glyoxylate cycle, oxylipin metabolism, myoinositol synthesis pathway and a subset of thioredoxins were also modulated. Moreover, we performed the annotation of transcription factor and transcriptional regulator genes and the results revealed novel candidate regulator genes that were exclusively expressed during mixotrophic growth phase including members of MYB (V-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog) and bZIP (Basic Leucine Zipper) protein families. Thus, our findings indicated that the high specific growth rate observed in cells under mixotrophy is likely supported by the induction of abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms via inositol and its derivatives and increased resistance to oxidative stress through the modulation of the expression of thioredoxins. Therefore, the identification of novel candidate genes in mixotrophy may contribute to the development of microalgae strains with higher growth capacity and better performance for biomass production.;[Giraldi, Lais Albuquerque| Winck, Flavia V.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Chem, Dept Biochem, Lab Regulatory Syst Biol, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil| [Vidotti, Annamaria D.

Conventional treatment by neutralization/precipitation of an AMD from a coal mine in Brazil was conducted with Ca(OH)(2) at pH 8.7. Algal growth studies were performed in the treated AMD, with and without a nutrient supply. The raw effluent and treatments were compared in terms of residual concentration of metals and sulfate, conductivity, and toxicity with theAllium cepaandDaphnia magnatest organisms. The results show that the conventional treatment allowed a major metal removal, reduction in the conductivity, and good indices in the toxicological parameters evaluated. The biosorption with in vivo microalgae improved the quality of the effluent for residual metals. No significant toxicity was observed toAllium cepain all treatments performed, while theDaphnia magnatest indicated a reduction in toxicity after the biosorption step.

The lipid-bearing Dunaliella salina biomass was grown in bubble column photobioreactors, yielding 100 g of biomass and 20 g of oil containing high content of saturated (37.8%) and monounsaturated fatty acids (41.2%) and a low content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (20.9%). The reaction assays were carried out in 50 mL glass reactor containing 10 g of medium composed by microbial oil and fusel oil components (ethyl, butyl, or isoamyl alcohols) and fusel oil as acyl acceptors at a fixed molar ratio of 1:8 (oil to alcohol) using iso-octane as solvent. Batch runs were performed at 45 degrees C under constant magnetic stirring (150 rpm) for a maximum of 120 h. Macaw palm oil was used as a control under the same reaction conditions. The biocatalyst was found to be efficient in converting the microalgal oil fatty acids into their corresponding alkyl esters attained yields ranging from 70.8 to 89.0% at 120 h reaction, depending on size of the alcohol chain. The kinematic viscosities of the esters produced confirmed the high transesterification yields, considering the viscosity of microalgae oil decreased from 60.1 to a range of 8.9-11.3 m(2) s(-1) (40 degrees C) after the enzymatic modification.;[Da Silva, Ana Paula T.| de Castro, Heizir F.| Da Ros, Patricia C.

Most studies concerning their toxicity to microalgae have only considered short-term individual PhAC exposure, rather than combined exposure to several compounds for longer time periods. In this study, we investigated the effects of albendazole (ABZ) (anthelmintic) and carbamazepine (antiepileptic), alone and in combination with caffeine, on the growth and production of chlorophyll-a of the microalgaeRaphidocelis subcapitata, during 16 days of exposure. ABZ alone had a more significant effect than carbamazepine alone on the growth rate and maximum cell density of the microalgae (p < .05| analysis of variance). These results were probably related to the effect of ABZ in inhibiting enzyme complexes and cell membrane proteins related to adenosine triphosphate synthesis, which is important for cell growth. The presence of caffeine lowered the toxicities of ABZ and carbamazepine to the microalgae, probably due to its antioxidant properties, positively affecting chlorophyll-a production, growth rate, and maximum cell density. Thus, caffeine had an antagonistic interaction with the studied PhACs. The results reinforce the importance of ecotoxicological assays that compare individual and combined PhAC exposure conditions. Our findings highlighted that caffeine can be a relevant factor influencing such assays, considering its widespread occurrence in impacted water bodies.;[Diniz, Vinicius| Cunha, Davi G.

Microalgae have also been explored as an alternative wastewater treatment solution due to their significant uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as their ability to grow in different water types. Recently, there has been significant interest in combining these two characteristics to create economic and environmentally friendly biofuel using wastewater. This study examined the growth and lipid production of the microalgaePorphyridium (P.) cruentumgrown in swine wastewater (ultra-filtered and raw) as compared with control media (L-1, modified f/2) at two different salt concentrations (seawater and saltwater). The cultivation ofP. cruentumin the treated swine wastewater media (seawater = 5.18 +/- 2.3 mgL(-1)day(-1), saltwater = 3.32 +/- 1.93 mgL(-1)day(-1)) resulted in a statistically similar biomass productivity compared to the control medium (seawater = 2.61 +/- 2.47 mgL(-1)day(-1), saltwater = 6.53 +/- 0.81 mgL(-1)day(-1)) at the corresponding salt concentration. Furthermore, no major differences between the fatty acid compositions of microalgae in the treated swine wastewater medium and the control medium were observed. For all conditions, saturated acids were present in the highest amounts (>= 67%), followed by polyunsaturated (<= 22%) and finally monounsaturated (<= 12%). This is the first study to find thatP. cruentumcould be used to remediate wastewater and then be turned into fuel by using swine wastewater with a similar productivity to the microalgae grown in control media.;[Erol, Humeyra B.

TR9 and Coccomyxa simplex are desiccation-tolerant microalgae with flexible cell walls, which undergo species-specific remodelling during dehydration-rehydration (D/R) due to their distinct ultrastructure and biochemical composition. Here, we tested the hypothesis that extracellular polysaccharides excreted by each microalga could be quantitatively and/or qualitatively modified by D/R. Extracellular polysaccharides were analysed by size exclusion and anion exchange chromatography, specific stains after gel electrophoresis and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of trimethylsilyl derivatives (to determine their monosaccharide composition). The structure of a TR9-sulfated polymer was deduced from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. In addition, sugar-sulfotransferase encoding genes were identified in both microalgae, and their expression was measured by RT-qPCR. D/R did not alter the polydispersed profile of extracellular polysaccharides in either microalga but did induce quantitative changes in several peaks. Furthermore, medium-low-sized uronic acid-containing polysaccharides were almost completely substituted by higher molecular mass carbohydrates after D/R. Sulfated polysaccharide(s) were detected, for the first time, in the extracellular polymeric substances of both microalgae, but only increased significantly in TR9 after cyclic D/R, which induced a sugar-sulfotransferase gene and accumulated sulfated ss-D-galactofuranan(s). Biochemical remodelling of extracellular polysaccharides in aeroterrestrial desiccation-tolerant microalgae is species-specific and seems to play a role in the response to changes in environmental water availability.;[Gonzalez-Hourcade, Maria| del Campo, Eva M.| Casano, Leonardo M.] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Life Sci, Madrid 28871, Spain| [Braga, Marcia R.] Inst Bot, Dept Plant Physiol & Biochem, BR-04301012 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil| [Salgado, Antonio] Univ Alcala De Henares, Fac Pharm, Ctr Espectroscopia RMN CERMN, Madrid 28805, Spain;Casano, LM (corresponding author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Life Sci, Madrid 28871, Spain.;leonardo.casano@uah.es;Casano, Leonardo M.

Microalgae are abundant and have an important role on the food chain. Consequently, they stand out as promising models for studies of contaminants. This study investigated the cytotoxic effects of atrazine and copper (separate and mixture) exposure in microalgae Desmodesmus communis, as well as its cellular defense due to ABC (ATP-binding cassette) proteins activity against the xenobiotics. We analyzed two different ABC proteins activity pathways: P-gp, which is responsible for nonspecific substance efflux, and MRP that is associated with metals efflux. It was observed that the microalgae exposure to atrazine (90 nM) and copper (141 nM) has been considered cytotoxic. When contaminants were mixed, only the combination of both highest concentrations tested was cytotoxic. The P-gp blocker, verapamil, demonstrated that the contaminants tested caused proteins inhibition. However, the MK-571 (MRP blocker) did not block pump activity. There was an inverse relationship between ABC protein activity and cytotoxicity| non-cytotoxic conditions suggest increased activity of microalgae defense proteins.;[Guidony, Nicole Soares| Souza, Marta Marques] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Programa Posgrad Biol Ambientes Aquat Continentai, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil| [Lopes, Fernanda Moreira| Venquiaruti Escarrone, Ana Laura| Souza, Marta Marques] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Fisiol, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil| [Guimaraes, Pablo Santos| Souza, Marta Marques] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Ciencias Biol, Av Italia,Km 8, Rio Grande 96203900, RS, Brazil;Souza, MM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Programa Posgrad Biol Ambientes Aquat Continentai, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.| Souza, MM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Fisiol, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.| Souza, MM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Ciencias Biol, Av Italia,Km 8, Rio Grande 96203900, RS, Brazil.;martasouza@furg.br;;Soares Guidony Pereira, Nicole/0000-0003-1502-4649;CAPESCAPES [200401/2008-P0] Funding Source: Medline| CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [311806/2017-1] Funding Source: Medline| CNPq - INCTNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [573949/2008-5] Funding Source: Medline;;;43;1;1;10;12;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;0944-1344;1614-7499;;ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R;Environ.

The experimental data, obtained from a bench-scale facility, were used to estimate the life cycle impacts of a wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 16,000 m(3)/d, with a production of 4.32 ton/d of biomass, fractioned in 0.84 ton/d of bulk oil and 3.45 ton/d of LEA. The sustainability metrics of the integrated process indicate a net energy ratio of 0.41, reduction of 98% of the water footprint, global warming potential of 47 x 10(6) kgCO(2eq)/y, eutrophication potential of 5 x 10(4) kg eq PO4/y, acidification potential of 7 x 10(4) kg SO2-eq/y and ozone depletion potential of 3.33 kg CFC-11-eq/y.

In this way, the optimization of culture medium of these microorganisms can help to reduce production costs, making final products more accessible. In this sense, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of different trace metal concentrations on growth and biochemical composition of Scenedesmus obliquus. Cultures of S. obliquus were performed using the LCA-AD medium (pH 7.6), in 2-L cylindrical borosilicate glass flasks that were constantly stirred by bubbling 0.7% CO2 enriched air (v/v), irradiance ranging from 520 to 1200 mu mols m(-2) s(-1), and temperature at 22 +/- 1 degrees C. Four trace metal concentrations were tested: control (standard concentration used on Bold's Basal Medium), ten (10(-1)), hundred (10(-2)), and thousand (10(-3)) times less than control. The trace metal concentration did not significantly affect the growth of S. obliquus - all treatments have reached about 4.2 g L-1 on the tenth day of cultivation. As well for growth performance, no significant differences were observed among the treatments for biomass composition percentages. The dry S. obliquus biomass was mainly composed of carbohydrates (about 65%), crude protein (about 20%), and finally lipids (about 12%). These findings suggest that up to 1000-fold reduction in trace metal concentration does not affect the growth and biochemical composition of the green microalga S. obliquus.;[de Oliveira, Carlos Yure Barbosa| Viegas, Thayna Lie| Lopes, Rafael Garcia| Derner, Roberto Bianchini] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Aquaculture, Lab Algae Cultivat, Servidao Coroas 503, BR-88061600 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [da Silva, Maria Fernanda Oliveira| Fracalossi, Debora Machado] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Aquaculture, Lab Fish Nutr, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil;de Oliveira, CYB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Aquaculture, Lab Algae Cultivat, Servidao Coroas 503, BR-88061600 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;yureboliveira@gmail.com;de Oliveira, Carlos Yure Barbosa/V-1726-2019| Derner, Roberto Bianchini/F-1766-2015;de Oliveira, Carlos Yure Barbosa/0000-0001-9237-1869| Derner, Roberto Bianchini/0000-0001-6474-1287;Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) by FINEP [01.10.0457.00]| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [PQ 308076/2014-1, 574796/2008-8]| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior BrazilCAPES [001];The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) for financial support provided by FINEP (Agreement No. 01.10.0457.00), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (Case No. 574796/2008-8 and PQ 308076/2014-1, for the aid granted to Professor Debora Machado Fracalossi), and Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior Brazil (Finance Code 001).;;42;1;1;7;19;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0967-6120;1573-143X;;AQUACULT INT;Aquac.

Thus, the objective of this work was to develop an environmentally friendly sequential process to obtain lutein and biodiesel from Choricystis minor var. minor microalga. To overcome these challenges, the wet biomass of this microalga was dried in the sun, and lutein was obtained in an optimized extraction using methanolic solution containing potassium hydroxide, followed by the extraction of fatty acids and conversion into biodiesel using methanolic solution with phosphoric acid. The optimum conditions for lutein extraction were 0.3 mL of methanolic solution with 8% potassium hydroxide, at 60 degrees C for 1 hour. Then, the residual biomass was used to produce biodiesel by acid catalysis, with addition of 0.8 mL of methanolic solution containing 10% phosphoric acid at 100 degrees C for 1 hour. This approach obtained 1 kg of lutein and 10.83 kg of biodiesel from 75.75 kg of dry biomass of microalga. From the economical point of view, biodiesel is a less valuable coproduct of the lutein production chain.;[D'Alessandro, Emmanuel Bezerra| Soares, Aline Terra| Antoniosi Filho, Nelson Roberto] Univ Fed Goias, Inst Quim, Lab Metodos Extracao & Separacao LAMES, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil| [Lopes, Rafael Garcia| Derner, Roberto Bianchini] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Dept Aquicultura, LCA, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil;D'Alessandro, EB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Goias, Inst Quim, Lab Metodos Extracao & Separacao LAMES, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil.;dalessandro.e.b@gmail.com;Filho, Nelson Roberto Antoniosi/R-8297-2019| Derner, Roberto Bianchini/F-1766-2015| D'Alessandro, Emmanuel Bezerra/I-2662-2017;Filho, Nelson Roberto Antoniosi/0000-0002-3067-0385| Derner, Roberto Bianchini/0000-0001-6474-1287| D'Alessandro, Emmanuel Bezerra/0000-0003-4294-5793;Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) [23070.007680/2016-30];The infrastructure used in this project was financially supported by Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC), process No. 23070.007680/2016-30.;;57;1;1;0;7;TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC;PHILADELPHIA;530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA;0098-6445;1563-5201;;CHEM ENG COMMUN;Chem.

However, reports are available indicating that sometimes this may not be the case. This work studied the existence of delays on the response of a population of microalgae when subjected to changes in energy and carbon sources, and when exposed to a growth inhibitor. Results show that no appreciable delays exist when microalgae undergo changes in the incident light intensity. For changes in carbon source concentration (inorganic carbon), a small delay in the range of minutes was detected. Finally, when exposing microalgae to inhibitory concentrations of ammonia, a significant delay of several hours was observed.;[Zuniga, Hector| Jeison, David] PUCV, Escuela Ingn Bioquim, Ave Brasil 2085, Valparaiso 2362803, Chile| [Vergara, Christian] Univ La Frontera, Chem Engn Dept, Av Francisco Salazar 01145, Temuco 4811230, Chile| [Donoso-Bravo, Andres] Cetaqua, Ctr Tecnol Agua, Los Pozos 7340, Santiago 7570475, Chile;Jeison, D (corresponding author), PUCV, Escuela Ingn Bioquim, Ave Brasil 2085, Valparaiso 2362803, Chile.;hector.zuniga.barra@gmail.com| christian.vergara@ufrontera.cl| andreseduardo.donoso@cetaqua.com| david.jeison@pucv.cl;Jeison, David/M-5313-2017;Jeison, David/0000-0002-2234-8257;Center forWater Resources for Agriculture and Mining [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130015];Authors want to thank the financial support provided by the Center forWater Resources for Agriculture and Mining (CONICYT/FONDAP/15130015).;;26;1;1;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2227-9717;;PROCESSES;Processes;JAN;2020;8;1;;;;;;;87;10.3390/pr8010087;;;11;Engineering, Chemical;Engineering;KQ3KL;WOS:000516825300074;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-01-01

First, a chemical fixation, where CO2 was injected in alkalinized vinasse to form (bi)carbonate salts, was performed. In addition, biological fixation with CO2-enriched air injection was also accomplished for evaluation of the most promising results. Two bioreactor systems, a stirred-tank reactor and a bubble column reactor, were employed. A higher carbon transfer rate (43.35 g.L-1.h(-1)) was achieved in the bubble column reactor using NaOH-alkalinized vinasse, along with reductions of the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and turbidity (TD). This allowed the cultivation of microalgae and cyanobacteria at vinasse concentrations between 70 and 100%, reaching a biomass production of 2.25 g.L-1 in 15 days of culture. The viability of chemical CO2 fixation together with the use of 100% treated vinasse from a bioethanol production unit for microalgae cultivation has been demonstrated in a successfully integrated biorefinery approach.;[Sydney, Eduardo Bittencourt| Novak Sydney, Alessandra Cristine] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana, Dept Bioproc Engn & Biotechnol, BR-84016210 Ponta Grossa, Parana, Brazil| [Dalmas Neto, Carlos Jose| de Carvalho, Julio Cesar| de Souza Vandenberghe, Luciana Porto| Junior Letti, Luiz Alberto| Karp, Susan Grace| Soccol, Vanete Thomaz| Woiciechowski, Adenise Lorenci| Pedroni Medeiros, Adriane Bianchi| Soccol, Carlos Ricardo] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Bioproc Engn & Biotechnol, Ctr Politecn, BR-81531990 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil;Soccol, CR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Dept Bioproc Engn & Biotechnol, Ctr Politecn, BR-81531990 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.;soccol@ufpr.br;Karp, Susan Grace/C-5728-2016| Soccol, Vanete Thomaz/F-2392-2015;Karp, Susan Grace/0000-0001-7497-1641| Soccol, Vanete Thomaz/0000-0001-9301-541X| Vandenberghe, Luciana/0000-0003-0267-1185;Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [407543/2013-0]| Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)CAPES| enterprise Ourofino Agrociencia, Brazil;This work was supported in part by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [grant number 407543/2013-0]| the Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) [PROEX program]| and the enterprise Ourofino Agrociencia, Brazil.;;25;1;1;0;20;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;0960-8524;1873-2976;;BIORESOURCE TECHNOL;Bioresour.

This study aim was to evaluate, through biochemical and genetic biomarkers, the safety of RAB in catfish, Rhamdia quelen, feed. Acutodesmus obliquus microalgae RAB, cultivated in Chu medium, was used in feed formulation. A standard feed without RAB (0%) was produced, and three other feeds were enriched with RAB in 1, 2, and 3% proportion. Each feed kind was given to a 15 R. quelen fingerling group for 60 days. The evaluated biochemical biomarkers were superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the liver, and acetilcolinesterase (AChE) activity in the brain and muscles. The genetic biomarkers analyzed were halo assay in erythrocytes, comet assay in erythrocytes, liver and brain, and piscine micronucleus. The SOD activity was increased in the 3% group| CAT activity and LPO levels were not different among the groups. In the comet assay, a significant decrease in DNA damage in erythrocytes (2 and 3%) and liver tissue (3%) was observed. In the brain, DNA damage was not observed. These results corroborate that as the RAB amount increased, the organisms showed a potential antioxidant effect, as the 3% RAB feed had the best results.;[Meister Luz Marques, Antonio Ernesto| Taher, Dhyogo Mileo| Coelho Vargas, Jose Viriato| Mariano, Andre Bellin| Cestari, Marta Margarete] Fed Univ Paran UFPR, Ctr Res & Dev Sustainable Energy NPDEAS, BR-80050540 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [Meister Luz Marques, Antonio Ernesto| Motta, Cintya Marques| Cestari, Marta Margarete] UFPR, Anim Cytogenet & Environm Mutagenesis Lab, Dept Genet, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [Balen, Rafael Ernesto| Meurer, Fabio] UFPR, Aquaculture Technol Lab, Dept Zool, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [Pereira Fernandes, Leticia da Silva| Silva de Assis, Helena Cristina] UFPR, Environm Toxicol Lab, Dept Pharmacol, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [Coelho Vargas, Jose Viriato] UFPR, Dept Mech Engn, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [Mariano, Andre Bellin] Ctr Politecn, Dept Engn Eletr, Setor Tecnol, Ave Coronel Francisco H dos Santos S-N,CP 19011, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil;Mariano, AB (corresponding author), Fed Univ Paran UFPR, Ctr Res & Dev Sustainable Energy NPDEAS, BR-80050540 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.| Mariano, AB (corresponding author), Ctr Politecn, Dept Engn Eletr, Setor Tecnol, Ave Coronel Francisco H dos Santos S-N,CP 19011, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.;antonio.marques84@gmail.com| rebalen@yahoo.com.br| pereiraletsilva@gmail.com| aghatacindy0123@gmail.com| helassis@ufpr.br| dhyogomt@gmail.com| fabio_meurer@yahoo.com.br| vargasjvcv@gmail.com| andrebmariano@ufpr.br| margaces@ufpr.br;de Assis, Helena C Silva/C-4518-2013| Mariano, Andre Bellin/G-7843-2012| Meurer, Fabio/AAI-2651-2020| Vargas, Jose V/K-6346-2013;de Assis, Helena C Silva/0000-0002-1944-5726| Mariano, Andre Bellin/0000-0002-1693-8947| Meurer, Fabio/0000-0002-8389-9888| Vargas, Jose V/0000-0002-1458-2908| Balen, Rafael/0000-0002-6108-3060| Fernandes, Leticia/0000-0003-4298-4258;CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| CAPESCAPES [40001016006P1];This work was financially supported by CNPq and CAPES under the grant [grant numbers 40001016006P1].;;64;1;1;1;7;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0921-8971;1573-5176;;J APPL PHYCOL;J.

In this study, the phycoremediation of a secondary urban effluent by native microalgae was investigated using a photobioreactor designed to receive carbon dioxide (CO2). The experiments were carried out with and without CO2 addition, and the physicochemical parameters of the effluent were monitored. The biomass yield was determined as the dry weight, and both the lipid and fatty acid profiles were obtained by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. RESULTS With respect to biomass production, lipid content and phycoremediation of the secondary urban effluent, the best results were observed in the experiments using CO2. In these experiments, reductions of biological oxygen demand (54.34%), total phosphorus (92.4%), ammoniacal nitrogen (97.1%) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (92.8%) were observed. The CO2 addition also enhanced microalgae growth, as the maximum cell density (MCD) was 54.26% higher after a shorter period of time compared to the MCD obtained without CO2 addition. The biomass yields were 0.5324 +/- 0.007 g L-1 and 0.821 +/- 0.014 g L-1 without and with CO2 addition, respectively. The lipid yields per unit of biomass for the CO2 supplemented cultures were not statistically different from cultures that were not supplemented with CO2, and the same was observed for fatty acid composition. CONCLUSION The use of the mixed-type photobioreactor has been shown to be a potential alternative method for biomass production and wastewater phycoremediation.

Aiming to understand the effects of the application of magnetic field, along with illuminance, on the growth of microalgae, an accurate first-principles mathematical model must be designed and evaluated. Furthermore, the parameters associated with illuminance and magnetic field in the new model must be obtained through a reliable and robust parameter estimation procedure, since for magnetic field effects there are no models and parameters reported in the literature. RESULTS A new model for microalga growth with application of illuminance and magnetic field was designed to predict biomass productivity. Fourteen different Verhulst-based mathematical equations were proposed and compared. The results showed the significant influence of the illuminance and magnetic field on the microalga growth and indicated that the designed model accurately fitted the experimental data. CONCLUSIONS A new model to predict microalga growth with application of illuminance and magnetic field was designed considering two new parameters, K-I and K-M, affinity of a microorganism to illuminance and magnetic field, respectively, in a Verhulst-based equation. The parameters were accurately estimated though a hybrid combination of particle swarm optimization and nonlinear least-squares algorithms, allowing the model to accurately predict microalga growth.

In this work, we are interested in the storage of water by these microalgae. A model based on the statistical physics formalism is one of the supports for imagining the arrangement of water molecules on Spirulina surface. On the basis of this method, we have interpreted, on a microscopic scale, adsorption isotherms of water molecules by the Spirulina biomass at three temperatures (283 K, 293 K and 303 K). We interpret the results of the fit through the parameters involved in the model namely the number of water molecules adsorbed per site n, the receptor sites density D and the energetic parameters e(1w) and e(2w), determined by fitting the experimental adsorption isotherms. Lastly we calculated the thermodynamic functions which govern the adsorption process such as entropy, free enthalpy and internal energy. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Despite their increasing popularity, the selection of design parameters is delicate and is usually performed in an ad-hoc fashion. In this study, a robust design procedure is developed based on assumptions related to the boundedness of the uncertainties, and a computational procedure based on semi-definite programming is proposed and tested in simulation. Specifically, this procedure is applied to the design of STOs to monitor the internal substrate quota in cultures of micro-algae in photo-bioreactors, which is a key variable in the Droop model and cannot be measured on-line. Using the measurements of the concentrations of biomass and substrate in the culture medium, a state estimation scheme based on two STOs, one for the cell growth rate and the other for the substrate uptake rate, is therefore developed.

Microalgal cell growth dynamics are commonly monitored by measuring the optical density (OD) of the culture, which then is converted to either biomass dry weight or cell concentration with the aid of standard curves. However, starch accumulation causes changes in the cell morphology, which may impair the use of OD for the measurement of cell growth. Therefore, this study investigated the correlation of OD to cell concentration and dry weight during the cultivation of Chlorella sorokiniana, a starch-accumulating green microalga. A linear correlation between OD and cell concentration was observed only during the exponential and the decelerating growth phases. The OD increase during the stationary phase was related to starch accumulation rather than to cell growth. Similarly, a lack of correlation between OD and biomass dry weight occurred during the stationary growth phase, as the increase of dry weight, due to the pronounced starch accumulation, was greater than the OD changes. Thus, this study shows that the use of OD to measure microalgal cell growth in starch-accumulating cultures can be misleading. The direct measurement of cell concentration and dry weight is advisable for monitoring the full cell growth cycle and accurately calculating biomass productivity.;[de Souza, Marcella Fernandes| Rodrigues, Marcoaurelio Almenara| da Silva Bon, Elba Pinto] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Chem Inst, Bioethanol Lab, Av Pedro Calmon S-N, BR-21941596 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil| [Rodrigues, Marcoaurelio Almenara] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Lab Plant Biotechnol & Photosynth, Av Athos Silveira Ramos 149,Bl A Lab 532, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil| [Freitas, Suely Pereira] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Lab Proc Plant Feedstocks, LADEQ, Av Athos Silveira Ramos,Bl I, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil;de Souza, MF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Chem Inst, Bioethanol Lab, Av Pedro Calmon S-N, BR-21941596 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;cellafsouza@gmail.com;Freitas, Silverio/AAL-5642-2020| Rodrigues, Marcoaurelio Almenara/E-2620-2016| de Souza, Marcella Fernandes/AAQ-3044-2020;Freitas, Silverio/0000-0001-8497-2920| Rodrigues, Marcoaurelio Almenara/0000-0002-5217-0082| de Souza, Marcella Fernandes/0000-0002-4435-9221| Bon, Elba/0000-0002-0385-5448;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [4074812013];This work was financed by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) project Microalgae: production, characterization, and fractioning to obtain biofuels and bioproducts with bioactive potential [Grant Number 4074812013].;;30;1;1;1;15;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0921-8971;1573-5176;;J APPL PHYCOL;J.

Although a very recurrent method, it is not trivial to establish a single coacervation methodology to encapsulate different compounds. The optimal synthesis conditions, that resulted in the best yield and encapsulation efficiency, are 1:1 (m/m) wall-to-core ratio, a temperature of 40 degrees C and agitation speed of 10,000 rpm. Optical microscopy analysis revealed that the microcapsules are spherical, have average diameters of 112 mu m (A. vera) and 118 mu m (microalgae) and do not form agglomerates. The microcapsules were characterized by the osmotic pressure at which they ruptured, allowing the calculation of their mechanical resistance, which resulted in 392 MPa (A. vera) and 425 MPa (microalgae). The presented optimized methodology to encapsulate both compounds aims to contribute to their efficient and rational use, especially in cosmeceutical applications.;[Badke, Luiza Brescovici| da Silva, Bruno Campos| Bruno Marino, Claudia Eliana] Univ Fed Parana, UFPR, Dept Engn Mecan, Grp Biomat & Eletroquim, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [da Silva, Bruno Campos| Riegel-Vidotti, Izabel Cristina] Univ Fed Parana, UFPR, Dept Quim, Grp Pesquisa Macromol & Interfaces, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [de Carvalho-Jorge, Agne Roani] Inst Senai Inovacao Eletroquim, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [Taher, Dhyogo Mileo] Univ Fed Parana, UFPR, Nucleo Pesquisa & Desenvolvimento Energia Autosst, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil;Riegel-Vidotti, IC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, UFPR, Dept Quim, Grp Pesquisa Macromol & Interfaces, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.;izabel.riegel@ufpr.br;MARINO, CLAUDIA E B/H-8169-2017;MARINO, CLAUDIA E B/0000-0003-2660-4577| Riegel-Vidotti, Izabel/0000-0002-7649-8947| Brescovici Badke, Luiza/0000-0001-6104-7775;CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| CAPESCAPES [001]| CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [301989/2016-8, 309800/2014-5];Authors are grateful to PIPE-UFPR (Graduate Program of Engineering and Materials Science), NPDEAS-UFPR, and SENAI-PR.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) has proved to be an efficient and environmentally less impacting tool for the selection of microorganisms with biotechnological potential. This study aimed to apply FTIR for the selection of fungal strains with potential to hydrolyze the biomass of the microalgae Desmodesmus subspicatus and Chlorella sp after lipid extraction. Eleven fungal strains were screened for residual biomass hydrolysis and FTIR was applied followed by multivariate analysis for the selection of filamentous fungi. The highest cell density was 28.7 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) for Chlorella sp. and 15.8 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) for D. subspicatus and the values of total carbohydrates content were 23.1 and 16.9%, respectively. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were useful tools to screen fungal strains. After multivariate analysis, it was possible to observe that the fungi strains that presented the greatest ability to use microalgal biomass were Penicillium G12 due to the glucose and xylose sugars obtained after lipid extraction from D. subspicatus (with sugar yield of 9.4 and 6.6%, respectively) and Trichoderma auricularis for Chlorella sp. (with sugar yield of 12.9 and 9.6%, respectively).

Microalgal biomass has recently been in the highlight. The role of this biomass is here discussed within the concept of biorefinery and industrial sustainability of bioethanol production. The process of cultivation in order to accumulate around 50% of carbohydrates in the biomass (dry weight) and the importance of water and nutrient recycling are reviewed. Saccharification of biomass using enzymes or acids and alternative processes such as hydrothermal liquefaction and flash hydrolysis are addressed. Since the main monosaccharide in microalgal biomass is glucose, high rates of hydrolysis and fermentation were, generally, achieved (more than 80% of the efficiency as a sum of these two processes).

Alternative techniques for the concentration of bioethanol from fermentation broth and for the optimization of fuel transportation are mentioned.

Evaluation of algal diversity showed that the genera Euglena and Chlorella were present in relatively high frequencies in five of the six effluents analyzed. The use of EFAC on an effluent that presented bloom of Chlorella achieved turbidity and chlorophyll-a removal efficiencies higher than 70 and 90%, respectively, after 70 minutes of operation. Total lipid yield for the Chlorella-rich biomass was 21.4 +/- 2.02%. Such high biomass lipid content demonstrates the potential for obtaining lipid-based biofuels from wastes.

However, little is known about the interference that pigments produced by bacteria, such as the pyoverdine siderophore, can cause to microalgae like Isochrysis galbana. Pyoverdine is a fluorochrome produced by certain Pseudomonas strains, such as P. fluorescens, which plays a role in capturing and transporting iron ions from the environment to the cell. Unlike the oceans where Fe concentrations are extremely low (<10-15 mu M), in a ballast tank it is expected that there is a great supply of iron to the cells and that the absence of light is the main limiting factor until the water is discarded. Interestingly, under certain conditions, bacteria such as P. fluorescens absorb most of the water soluble iron ions and prevent the growth of phytoplankton even if there is sufficient light. Changes in the patterns of light distribution in aquatic environments may affect the physiological characteristics of certain microalgae. This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of the presence of P. fluorescens on the survival and growth of I. galbana inside the tank. For the study, an experiment was carried out to study the interaction between P. fluorescens and I. galbana under simulated conditions of a vessel in the presence/absence of Pseudomonas and light. The results showed that the presence of the bacteria is not the main limiting factor for microalga growth. The effect of the light factor was determinant on the reproduction rate. It is believed that pyoverdine produced by P. fluorescens affected I. galbana stock either by increasing mortality or decreasing growth rate as revealed by laboratory experiments. However, it was not possible to check if the pigment concentration was affected by the growth of microalgae.;[Camara, Aline da Silva| de Almeida Fernandes, Lohengrin Dias] Brazilian Navy, Lab Microbiol & Cytometry, Biofouling & Bioinvas Div, Marine Biotechnol Dept,IEAPM, Rua Kioto 253, BR-28930000 Arraial Do Cabo, RJ, Brazil| [Camara, Aline da Silva| de Almeida Fernandes, Lohengrin Dias] IEAPM, Programa Posgrad Biotecnol Marinha, Rua Daniel Barreto S-N, BR-28930000 Arraial Do Cabo, Brazil;Camara, AD (corresponding author), Brazilian Navy, Lab Microbiol & Cytometry, Biofouling & Bioinvas Div, Marine Biotechnol Dept,IEAPM, Rua Kioto 253, BR-28930000 Arraial Do Cabo, RJ, Brazil.| Camara, AD (corresponding author), IEAPM, Programa Posgrad Biotecnol Marinha, Rua Daniel Barreto S-N, BR-28930000 Arraial Do Cabo, Brazil.;alinescamara@gmail.com| lohengrin@marinha.mil.br;DA Fernandes, Lohengrin/C-2334-2009;DA Fernandes, Lohengrin/0000-0002-8579-2363;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq);The authors would like to thank the IEAPM/Brazilian Navy for helping, for logistic support and laboratory structure and to Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-CNPq for the funding through grants during all period of realization of this research.;;33;1;1;0;15;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0302-8933;1432-072X;;ARCH MICROBIOL;Arch.

To attend that need, we evaluated the characteristics of 12 regional species of microalgae grown under controlled cultivation conditions (temperature = 24 +/- 1 degrees C, illumination 150 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), photoperiod of 12 h) in terms of their nutritional quality and lipid profiles. Significant differences in growth characteristics and chemical compositions were observed among the species investigated. High carbohydrate contents (> 25 g 100 g(-1)) were recorded in various strains of Chlorococcum and the marine microalga Amphidinium carterae| high protein contents (> 35 g 100 g(-1)) were observed in Scenedesmus acuminatus and Pediastrum tetras| and high lipid contents (> 25 g 100 g(-1)) in A. carterae and some strains of Chlorococcum sp. (cf. hypnosporum). Chlamydomonas sp. demonstrated the greatest production of carotenoids (64.92 mg g(-1)), chlorophyll-a (234.74 mg g(-1)), and chlorophyll-b (59.34 mg g(-1)). The lipid profiles of Chlorella cf. minutissima, four strains of Chlorococcum sp. (cf. hypnosporum), P. tetras, Planktothrix isothrix, and S. acuminatus indicated the presence of palmitic, oleic (omega-9), linoleic (omega-6) and alpha-linolenic (omega-3) acids, with more than 50% omegas in the total composition of their fatty acids. In terms of chemical nutrients, the microalgae cited were found to be potential sources of omegas, carotenoids, and chlorophylls that could be used in food industries.;[Barros Sassi, Katharina Kardinele| da Silva, Joao Andrade] Univ Fed Paraiba, Ctr Tecnol, Programa Posgrad Ciencia & Tecnol Alimentos, Campus 1, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil| [Calixto, Clediana Dantas| Sassi, Roberto| da Costa Sassi, Cristiane Francisca] Univ Fed Paraiba, Ctr Ciencias Exatas & Nat, Lab Ambientes Recifais & Biotecnol Microalgas LAR, Campus 1, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil;Sassi, KKB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Ctr Tecnol, Programa Posgrad Ciencia & Tecnol Alimentos, Campus 1, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.;kardinele@yahoo.com.br| joaoctdr@gmail.com| clediana_dantas@hotmail.com| sassi_rs@yahoo.com.br| cfcosta_ccosta@yahoo.com;;;Ministerio da Ciencia Tecnologia e Inovacao (MCTI)| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [407519/2013-0]| FinepCiencia Tecnologia e Inovacao (FINEP) [2557/09];The authors thank the Ministerio da Ciencia Tecnologia e Inovacao (MCTI), Finep (Processo: 2557/09), and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) (Processo: 407519/2013-0) for their financial support| Prof. Dr. Nelson R.

This study aimed to increase the linoleic acid content in distiller's grains and decrease the excess nutrients in stillage water by the use of an artificial lichen, composed of fungi, algae, and a supporting matrix. A maximum concentration of 46.25% of linoleic acid in distiller's grains was achieved with a combination of Mucor indicus and Chlorella vulgaris using corn-to-ethanol whole stillage as substrate. Microbial hydrolytic enzymes during fermentation were able to decrease the solids in whole stillage. Nitrogen depletion by microalgal uptake causes lipid-formation stress to Mucor indicus cells, increasing linoleic acid production to about 49% of the total lipids, potentially decreasing costs in the animal feed. The culture supernatant can potentially be recycled as process water to the ethanol fermentation tank, and enhanced distiller's grains can replace animal-specific diets. This would reduce exogenous enzyme use and supplementation of unsaturated fatty acids from other sources.;[Rodrigues Reis, Cristiano E.| D'Otaviano, Larissa Ogero| Rajendran, Aravindan| Hu, Bo] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA| [Rodrigues Reis, Cristiano E.| D'Otaviano, Larissa Ogero] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Chem Engn, Engn Sch Lorena, BR-12602810 Sao Paulo, Brazil;Hu, B (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;cristianoreis@usp.br| larissa.od@alunos.eel.usp.br| arajendr@umn.edu| bhu@umn.edu;;Hu, Bo/0000-0001-9786-3336| Rodrigues Reis, Cristiano Eduardo/0000-0002-9592-8084;Brazilian CAPES SwB program [13252/13-5]| FAPESP (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2017/12908-8, 2016/10636-8]| University of Minnesota-MnDRIVE| Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCCMR)-Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund;The researchers were funded by Brazilian CAPES SwB program (grant number 13252/13-5), to FAPESP (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo-grant numbers 2017/12908-8 and 2016/10636-8), to University of Minnesota-MnDRIVE (GFV and UMII), and to Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCCMR)-Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund.;;16;1;1;2;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2311-5637;;FERMENTATION-BASEL;FERMENTATION;DEC;2018;4;4;;;;;;;86;10.3390/fermentation4040086;;;9;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology| Food Science & Technology;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology| Food Science & Technology;HH0BV;WOS:000455378100006;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-01-01

A previous study demonstrated that reducing air bubble diameters from 9 mm to 6.5 mm through nozzle diameter reduction from a single injector with a 3 mm diameter to a set of nine injectors with diameter of 1 mm resulted in higher biomass yields of the marine microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica without any extra energy demand. However, the main differences in microalgae growth were only observed after 4 to 6 days of cultivation. We hypothesize that this difference may be triggered either by improved nutrient supply and/or higher light exposure of microalgae cells| both provided by the smaller bubbles improved the hydrodynamic mixing performance. In this study, nutrient concentration (Ammonium, Nitrate and Phosphate) and irradiance measurements were conducted over 10 days when N. oceanica was cultivated in 330 L cylindrical photobioreactors and a 1600 L open circular tank with different air bubble sizes (6.5 mm and 9 mm). A higher biomass was obtained in the treatments with smaller bubbles, but this difference was only significant after a least 4 days. The results show that the nutrient concentration did not differ significantly between treatments. However, the main differences in biomass production occurred when light was considerably reduced (< 50 mu mol photons m(-2)s(-2)), indicating that light is a limiting growth factor| however, this limitation can be partially surpassed by the improved mixing condition created by the higher mass transfer coefficient of the smaller bubbles. This finding is supported by Lagrangian simulations, which show that the trajectories of the microalgae particles/cells presented higher light exposure frequency in the treatment with the smaller air bubbles.;[Kubelka, Bruno Galler| Roselet, Fabio| Abreu, Paulo Cesar] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Lab Microalgae Prod, Inst Oceanog, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil| [Kubelka, Bruno Galler| Pinto, Waldir Terra] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Engn Sch, Lab Fluid Struct Interact, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil;Kubelka, BG (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande, Lab Microalgae Prod, Inst Oceanog, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.;brunokubelka@furg.br;Roselet, Fabio/S-6421-2016| Abreu, Paulo/A-5145-2013;Roselet, Fabio/0000-0002-1428-664X| Abreu, Paulo/0000-0002-7657-1112;Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - CAPESCAPES| project Costs and productivity evaluation for massive microalgae cultivation for biodiesel production;B.

Brazil's hydropower energy today makes up 68,5% of the total energy produced, in contrast however, photovoltaic energy production is still only 0.01%. As an effort to open up new frontiers for solar energy uses, the main objective of this project was to use solar energy in form of light to reduce the power consumption required for continuously lighting any kind of environment as well as to propose a new technology for illuminating a conventional window-type photobioreactor (PBR) in the cultivation of microalgae for biofiiel production in order to reduce their associated costs. The system is composed by a solar tracker, an electromechanical control, a Fresnel lens and a plastic optical fiber (POF) bundle, in which tip the lens concentrates the solar radiation. Therefore, at the other end of the bundle, the POFs can be distributed homogeneously in any local where one wants to illuminate. The solar tracker is able to track the Sun from sunrise to sunset using an algorithm whose function is to calculate the Sun position according to the local time and latitude using an equatorial mount structure. In addition, some sensors are employed for monitoring relevant parameters, for instance, the light intensity inside the POF bundle, the right ascension and declination angles of the tracker and the solar radiation. These parameters can be downloaded in real time through a specially designed mobile application. As application of the solar tracker, two projects were developed and described in this paper: two kinds of solar luminaires for illumination of internal ambiences and a closed photobioreactor by POF illumination, with nontransparent material, free of outside contamination with low cost and the study of the produced biomass through the lipid content. Both applications were compared in performance with their conventional counterparts and, as a conclusion, it is shown that in both cases they can substitute their conventional counterparts with advantages.;[Allil, Regina Celia| Manchego, Alfredo| Allil, Alexandre| Rodrigues, Igor| Werneck, Arthur| Werneck, Marcelo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Photon & Instrumentat Lab, Elect Engn Program, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil| [Diaz, Gisel Chenard| Dino, Fabio Toshio| Reyes, Yordanka] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Sch Chem, Lab Tecnol Verdes Greentec, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil;Werneck, M (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Photon & Instrumentat Lab, Elect Engn Program, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;werneck@lif.coppe.ufrj.br;Werneck, Marcelo/AAK-1551-2020;Reyes Cruz, Yordanka/0000-0002-2309-3698| Allil, Alexandre/0000-0002-2753-7014;Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro -FAPERJCarlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) [E-26/010.001962/2014];This project was partially funded by the Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro -FAPERJ, under the grant No E-26/010.001962/2014.;;21;1;1;1;12;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0038-092X;;;SOL ENERGY;Sol.

The purpose of this research was to evaluate the influence of the addition of cattle hair waste, microalgae biomass, or commercial silicone as a third co-substrate in the co-digestion of the two solid wastes of major concern to the leather industry: leather shavings and sludge from tannery wastewater treatment plants. The addition of cattle hair did not influence the total cumulative biogas production of 19.4 mL g(-1) of volatile suspended solid added, adsorbed practically all the chromium present, and increased by 16% the organic load of the medium, due to the hydrolysis of the hair damaging the treatment of the residues. The addition of microalgae doubled the cumulative biogas production, tripled the maximum daily biogas production, and adsorbed three times more chromium, showing its beneficial effect on the treatment of tannery solid waste for biogas production. The addition of commercial silicone did not influence the total cumulative biogas production but led to a high adsorption capacity for both chromium and organic matter.

Scenedesmus sp. and an algae mixture were separately cultivated in 20-L jugs by supplying two CO2 sources: air and diesel engine emissions. Microalgae growth rates were determined from absorbances and analyzed to construe whether emissions in lieu of air enhanced the microalgae growth. Also, a mini-photobioreactor (mPBR) was employed to grow local algae mixture with air and emissions as CO2 sources. The experimental results demonstrated that diesel engine emissions increased the growth of both Scenedesmus sp. and local algae mixture. The multi generation system thermal efficiency was defined as the sum of the total electrical power produced for cultivation in PBR, biomass harvesting, flocculation, separation, drying and oil extraction, followed by biodiesel production via transesterification reaction, plus the waste heat recovery and the heat generation rate potential of the produced biodiesel, divided by the heat input rate due to the combustion of consumed diesel fuel. In the absence of waste heat recovery, maximum thermodynamic efficiency of the system was 26%, while it increased to 36.2% with waste heat recovery and microalgae biodiesel, i.e., by 39.2%.

Sixty Angus x Simmental steers (438 +/- 6.4 kg) were allotted to two treatments (30 steers each, six pens, five steers/pen) to determine the effects of ForPLUS (DHA-rich microalgae Aurantiochytrium limacinum| 63.6% fat| 17.9% DHA| 30 mg/kg Sel-Plex| Alltech Inc.) on performance, insulin sensitivity, LM fatty acid composition, and meat quality. Steers were fed basal diets containing 45% corn, 30% distillers dried grains with solubles, 20% corn silage, and 5% supplement. Basal diets were formulated to contain 16.1% CP and 1.32 Mcal/kg NEg. Treatments were delivered to steers in a ground corn-based top-dress (454 g total/steer) and contained no microalgae for control steers or 100 g/steer daily of ForPLUS for microalgae steers. A glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed 10 d prior to slaughter. Steers were slaughtered when a target pen BW of 621 kg was achieved. Fatty acid oxidation potential was determined by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) on LM samples collected 24 h after slaughter and aged for 48 h or 21 d. Weight and BW gain did not differ during the study (P >= 0.13)| however, steers fed microalgae remained in the feedlot seven more days compared to steers fed the control diet (111 vs. 104 d| P = 0.04). Overall DMI decreased (P = 0.002) and G: F increased during the second half of the study (P = 0.04) in steers fed microalgae compared to steers fed the control diet. Steers fed microalgae secreted less insulin (P = 0.01) and took longer to clear glucose (P = 0.01) during a 2-h GTT. Carcass traits did not differ between treatments (P >= 0.23). Microalgae had no effect on n-6 content (P = 0.67), but more than doubled the n-3 fatty acid percentage and the n-3: n-6 ratio of the LM (P < 0.0001). The percentage of n-3 fatty acids C20: 5 and C22: 6 were increased (P < 0.0001) 4-fold and 6.25-fold, respectively, by microalgae supplementation. Concentration of TBARS did not differ in LM aged for 48 h (P = 0.91)| however, when aged for 21 d, steers fed microalgae tended to produce LM with greater TBARS concentration compared to steers fed the control diet (P = 0.08). In conclusion, DHA-rich microalgae decreased DMI of steers, and increased n-3 fatty acids and beef oxidation in steaks aged for 21 d.;[Carvalho, Jose Rodolfo R.| Ladeira, Marcio M.] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Anim Sci, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil| [Brennan, Kristen M.] Alltech Inc, Nicholasville, KY 40356 USA| [Schoonmaker, Jon P.] Purdue Univ, Dept Anim Sci, 270 S Russell St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA;Schoonmaker, JP (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Anim Sci, 270 S Russell St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;jschoonm@purdue.edu;Ladeira, Marcio M/G-9816-2012;Ladeira, Marcio M/0000-0002-1585-8486;Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)CAPES;Federal University of Lavras, Lavras, MG, Brazil| Scholarship provided by Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES).;;55;1;2;1;10;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;0021-8812;1525-3163;;J ANIM SCI;J.

When discarded directly into the wastewater treatment facilities, they may cause abrupt variations in effluent concentration compromising the performance of biological wastewater treatment. In this sense, the objective of this work was to assess the performance of heterotrophic microalgal bioreactor in the poultry and swine slaughterhouse wastewater treatment when submitted to organic shock loads. The experiments were performed in a bubble column bioreactor, operating at 25 degrees C, pH of 7.5, 100 mg/L of Phormidium autumnale, aeration of 1 VVM (volume of air per volume of culture per minute), and the absence of light. The organic shock loads were performed with 0.5%, 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, and 10% of a mixture of poultry and swine blood (50% v/v) in a residence time of 48 h. The kinetic data of cell growth and substrate consumption have been collected and analyzed. The results indicate a pronounced variation in removal efficiency as a function of evaluated pollutant (chemical oxygen demand 95.57%-98.90%| total nitrogen 61.85%-88.23%| total phosphorus 77.82%-90.64%). The numerical indices of process performance, besides framing the wastewater from the point of view of international legislation, demonstrate that the bioreactor support organic shock loads typical to that of the poultry and swine slaughterhouse industry can generate.;[dos Santos, Aline Meireles| dos Santos, Alberto Meireles| Sartori, Rafaela Basso| Queiroz, Leila Zepka| Jacob-Lopes, Eduardo] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Roraima Ave 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil;Jacob-Lopes, E (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Roraima Ave 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.;alinemeirelessm@hotmail.com| albertomsrs@gmail.com| rafaa.sartori@hotmail.com| lqz@pq.cupq.br| jacoblopes@pq.cnpq.br;;;;;;41;1;1;0;3;DESALINATION PUBL;HOPKINTON;36 WALCOTT VALLEY DRIVE,, HOPKINTON, MA 01748 USA;1944-3994;1944-3986;;DESALIN WATER TREAT;Desalin.

The aim of this study was to assess the possible toxic effects of acrylamide on physiological parameters of the Chlorophyceae Desmodesmus quadricauda. Cells in exponential growth phase were exposed for 72 h to different concentrations of acrylamide. Light microscopy analysis documented cell density, number of cells per coenobia, cell dimensions, and biovolume| chlorophyll a concentration was also determined. Result show that EC50 of acrylamide for D. quadricauda is 5.88 mg/L. Significant morphological changes were also observed for phenotypic plasticity and cellular dimensions. The most noticeable changes were the significant increase in one-celled coenobia over 24 and 48 h of exposure to EC50.

Haematococcus pluvialis is a green microalga known to synthesize and accumulate large amounts of carotenoids, among them astaxanthin. The objective of this work was to prepare and characterize dry extracts of H. pluvialis by spray drying technique, evaluating the effect of the use of pharmaceutical adjuvants and the drying parameters on the final characteristics of dry extracts. In addition, the antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of the carotenoids obtained from the dried extracts were evaluated. When the extraction of the carotenoids from the microalgae biomass was evaluated, high yield values ranging from 87.8% to 94.6% were obtained. After extraction and spray drying no differences in particle morphology were observed and bulk density and compacted values did not appear to be affected when different spray drying conditions were tested. It was observed that increasing the temperature and concentration of the drying aid provided a reduction in the total carotenoid content. The antioxidant activity values of carotenoid extracts varied between 55.78 and 77.83%, with the lowest values observed for the dry extracts prepared with the highest inlet temperature. The evaluation of the antiproliferative activity of carotenoid extracts showed that the highest concentrations tested reduced the viability of B16F10 murine melanoma cells from 66.58 and 82.91%. Thus, the results set showed that the extraction of dry extracts from the biomass of Haematococcus pluvialis for the production of pharmaceutical raw materials using spray drying is especially promising, with high total carotenoid values, and without significant loss of antioxidant activity.;[Loch-Neckel, Gecioni| Schutz, Francine Elisabeth| Lemos-Senna, Elenara] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Ciencias Saude, Dept Ciencias Farmaceut, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [Derner, Roberto Bianchini] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Dept Aquicultura, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil;Loch-Neckel, G (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Ciencias Saude, Dept Ciencias Farmaceut, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;gneckel@hotmail.com| francineschutz@yahoo.com.br| robertoderner@lcm.ufsc.br| lemos.senna@ufsc.br;Derner, Roberto Bianchini/F-1766-2015;Derner, Roberto Bianchini/0000-0001-6474-1287;;;;57;1;1;0;1;UNIV FED RIO DE JANEIRO, LAB HIDROGENIO;RIO DE JANEIRO RJ;CIDADE UNIV, ILHA DO FUNDAO, BLOCO I 2000, S L I 146, RIO DE JANEIRO RJ, CEP21941-972, BRAZIL;1517-7076;;;MATERIA-BRAZIL;Materia;;2018;23;4;;;;;;;e-12221;10.1590/S1517-707620180004.0555;;;16;Materials Science, Multidisciplinary;Materials Science;HD3LS;WOS:000452418700012;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-01-01

Using a microalgae biomass present in the Amazonian ecosystem (Macapa- AP), we study extraction methods for fatty acid such as solvent extraction (magnetic stirring and/or Soxhlet) and/or hydrolysis (acid and/or enzymatic catalysis) followed by esterification and/or direct transesterification. Extraction of crude triacylglycerides by mechanical stirring at room temperature was more efficient than continuous reflux (Soxhlet). Subsequently, the lipid extract was subject to transesterification with ethanol and CAL-B as a biocatalyst, leading to production of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE). Additionally, FAEEs were prepared by hydrolysis of crude triacylglycerides followed by acid-mediated esterification or enzymatic catalysis (lipase). In this case, the type of catalyst did not significantly influence FAEE yields. In the lipid extract, we identified palmitic, linoleic, oleic, and stearic acids with palmitic acid being the most abundant.

However, the costs associated with cultivation and processing still limit the scale-up of biomass production and its conversion into biofuels. One of the barriers associated with microalgae cultivation is the cost of nutrients used in heterotrophic and mixotrophic cultures. In this review were described and analyzed initiatives to explore effluents or coproducts from production chains of bioethanol and biodiesel for use as sources of nutrients for the cultivation of microalgae. With the purpose of reducing costs and integrating convergent agroindustrial chains, were evaluate the use of vinasse from the first generation of bioethanol plants, hemicellulosic hydrolyzate from the acid pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse, crude glycerol produced by the transesterification of oils and fats and washing water of biodiesel for the production of algal biomass.;[Moncao, Fernanda S.| Sartori, Marina L.| Veloso, Ronnie Von dos Santos] Univ Fed Vales Jequitinhonha & Mucuri, Programa Posgrad Biocombustiveis, Rodovia MGT 367,Km 583,5000, BR-39100000 Diamantina, MG, Brazil| [Pantoja, Lilian de A.] Univ Fed Vales Jequitinhonha & Mucuri, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol, Rodovia MGT 367,Km 583, 5000, BR-39100000 Diamantina, MG, Brazil| [dos Santos, Alexandre S.] Univ Fed Vales Jequitinhonha & Mucuri, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Rodovia MGT 367,Km 583, 5000, BR-39100000 Diamantina, MG, Brazil;Moncao, FS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vales Jequitinhonha & Mucuri, Programa Posgrad Biocombustiveis, Rodovia MGT 367,Km 583,5000, BR-39100000 Diamantina, MG, Brazil.;fernandasm.bio@gmail.com;Santos, Alexandre Soares dos/A-7154-2009;Santos, Alexandre Soares dos/0000-0003-2417-8084;;;;107;1;1;0;6;BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOC;NITEROI;SECRETERIA REGIONAL RIO DO JANEIRO, UNIV FED FLUMINENSE, NITEROI, RJ 24020-141, BRAZIL;1984-6835;;;REV VIRTUAL QUIM;Rev.

However, recent efforts to expand the culture catalogue/holdings have reached a ceiling because of the logistical practicality of maintaining actively growing cultures. In order to reduce the costs associated with the maintenance regime of cultures, efforts were initiated on the establishment of a cryopreserved biobank for long term maintenance of cultures, thus minimizing the efforts associated with handling of material, as successfully frozen cultures, in theory, could be maintained effectively indefinitely, with the advantage of the stability of cells characteristics. Initial tests were performed on 93 strains including exemplar taxa across the different taxonomic groups in the collection catalogue. The highest levels of success were achieved for the smaller taxa, such as the small green algae| while for the larger and more complex organisms limited to no success was obtained. For the strains tested, over 70% had positive good levels of post-thaw viability and regenerated phenotypically normal cultures.;[Tessarolli, Leticia Piton| Henriques Vieira, Armando Augusto] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Bot, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| [Day, John Godfrey] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Culture Collect Algae & Protozoa, Oban, Argyll, Scotland| [Day, John Godfrey] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Culture Collect Algae & Protozoa, Oban, Bute, Scotland;Tessarolli, LP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Bot, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;letessarolli@gmail.com;;;Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP);We thank the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) for financial support and scholarships.

In this work, Artemia franciscana received daily feedings of 10mgL(-1) of Tetraselmis chuii, Nannochloropsis oculata and Chaetoceros muelleri, which were grown using residual water from an intensive biofloc Litopenaeus vannamei cultivation system. The goal of this study was to verify which species provide the best zootechnical performance and best crustacean biomass production efficiency. After 12days of cultivation, A. franciscana wet biomass was 815.64 +/- 18.74, 650.81 +/- 83.98 and 40.76 +/- 4.08mgL(-1) with C. muelleri, T. chuii and N. oculata (P<0.05), with significant differences in dried biomass as well. As for the microalgae cultivation in the alternative culture medium, T. chuii had higher dry biomass gain, requiring less culture volume to achieve 10mgL(-1) and become ready to feed Artemia. Thus, T. chuii was the most efficient in Artemia biomass production with 0.83L compared to 1.54L gart(-1) in C. muelleri. C. muelleri is recommended for feeding A. franciscana for biomass production purposes. However, due to its better efficiency, T. chuii can be selected to be part of a multitrophic system.;[Magnotti, Caio| Lopes, Rafael| Derner, Roberto| Vinatea, Luis] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Dept Aquicultura, Lab Camaroes Marinhos, BR-88062601 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil;Vinatea, L (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Dept Aquicultura, Lab Camaroes Marinhos, BR-88062601 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;luis.vinatea@ufsc.br;Derner, Roberto Bianchini/F-1766-2015| VINATEA, LUIS/H-3376-2015| Lopes, Rafael/M-5426-2019| Magnotti, Caio/U-8345-2019| Magnotti, Caio/G-4436-2012;Derner, Roberto Bianchini/0000-0001-6474-1287| VINATEA, LUIS/0000-0002-3893-4728| Lopes, Rafael/0000-0001-7393-1824| Magnotti, Caio/0000-0002-1740-0540;Programa de Posgraduacao em Aquicultura of Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC)| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)CAPES [23038.052638/2009-23];The authors thank the Programa de Posgraduacao em Aquicultura of Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC) and Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) for the financial support (project Ciencias do mar 23038.052638/2009-23) and grants, and the whole team of Laboratorio de Camaroes Marinhos (LCM) e Laboratorio de Cultivo de Algas (LCA) for their contributions during the realization of this study.;;34;1;1;1;34;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1355-557X;1365-2109;;AQUAC RES;Aquac.

The aim of this study was to assess the capability of Nannochloropsis gaditana to grow in TOPW at different concentrations (10-80%) in order to valorize this processing water. Within this range, the highest increment of biomass was determined at percentage of 40% of TOPW, reaching an increment of 0.36 +/- 0.05 mg volatile suspended solids (VSS)/L. Components of algal biomass were similar for the experiments at 10-40% of TOPW, where proteins were the major compounds (56-74%). Total phenols were retained in the microalgae biomass (0.020 +/- 0.002 g of total phenols/g VSS). Experiments for 80% of TOPW resulted in a low production of microalgae biomass. High organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus and phenol removal were achieved in all TOPW concentrations. Although high-value products, such as proteins, were obtained and high removal efficiencies of nutrients were determined, microalgae biomass culture should be enhanced to become a suitable integral processing water treatment.;[Contreras, C.

Field samples were collected during four consecutive days: on the first three days the salt flat was dry, on the fourth day it was flooded by rain. In order to evaluate the community maintained in flood conditions, samples from this area were collected and kept in the laboratory for 10 days with sea water. The results of total abundance of microphytobenthos varied from 4.2 x 10(8) to 2.9 x 10(9) organisms L-1, total density increased one order of magnitude under the effect of water for both situations of precipitation in the salt flat and in experimental conditions, an increase due to the high abundance of Microcoleus spp. Shannon index (H') was higher during the desiccation period. Our data suggest that changes in the abundance of organisms were due to the effect of water. The dominance of the most abundant taxa remained the same under conditions of desiccation and influence of water, and there is probably a consortium of microorganisms in the microbial mat that helps to maintain these dominances.;[Masuda, L.

Growth was monitored by OD570 and the lipid content extracted through Bligh & Dyer (1959) method. Stressing D. spinosus increased lipid accumulation, but also a dramatic decrease in growth. C. vulgaris did not show any significant change in total lipid content or growth. Both C. vulgaris and A. fusiformis showed no signifi cant variation in total lipid content or growth, with only subtle changes. With different responses to the treatments for each species, it becomes clear the need for knowledge on the physiology and autoecology of the strain for commercial scale production.;[Martins, Gustavo Benevides| Fernandes, Valeria de Oliveira] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Ctr Ciencias Humanas & Nat, CCHN Bot, Av Fernando Ferrari 514, BR-29075910 Vitoria, ES, Brazil;Martins, GB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Ctr Ciencias Humanas & Nat, CCHN Bot, Av Fernando Ferrari 514, BR-29075910 Vitoria, ES, Brazil.;martinsbenevides@gmail.com| valeriaufes@yahoo.com.br;;;;;;39;1;1;1;11;FUNDACAO ZOOBOTANICA  RIO GRANDE SUL, MUSEU CIENCIAS NATURAIS;PORTO ALEGRE;CAIXA POSTAL 1188, PORTO ALEGRE, RS 00000, BRAZIL;;2446-8231;;IHERINGIA SER BOT;Iheringia Ser.

J;de Moraes, GP| Vieira, AAH;de Moraes, Guilherme Pavan| Augusto Henriques Vieira, Armando;Fourier Transform Infrared with Attenuated Total Reflectance Applied to the Discrimination of Freshwater Planktonic Coccoid Green Microalgae;PLOS ONE;English;Article;;SELENASTRACEAE CHLOROPHYCEAE| FTIR SPECTROSCOPY| IDENTIFICATION| CLASSIFICATION| PHYLOGENY| BACTERIA| ALGAE| TOOL| ACID;Despite the recent advances on fine taxonomic discrimination in microorganisms, namely using molecular biology tools, some groups remain particularly problematic. Fine taxonomy of green algae, a widely distributed group in freshwater ecosystems, remains a challenge, especially for coccoid forms. In this paper, we propose the use of the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as part of a polyphasic approach to identify and classify coccoid green microalgae (mainly order Sphaeropleales), using triplicated axenic cultures. The attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique was tested to reproducibility of IR spectra of the biological material, a primary requirement to achieve good discrimination of microalgal strains. Spectral window selection was also tested, in conjunction with the first derivative treatment of spectra, to determine which regions of the spectrum provided better separation and clustering of strains. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) and hierarchical clusters (HCA), demonstrated a correct discrimination and classification of closely related strains of chlorophycean coccoid microalgae, with respect to currently accepted classifications. FTIR-ATR was highly reproducible, and provided an excellent discrimination at the strain level. The best separation was achieved by analyzing the spectral windows of 1500-1200 cm(-1) and 900-675 cm(-1), which differs from those used in previously studies for the discrimination of broad algal groups, and excluding spectral regions related to storage compounds, which were found to give poor discrimination. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analyses have positioned the strains tested into clades correctly, reproducing their taxonomic orders and families. This study demonstrates that FTIR-ATR has great potential to complement classical approaches for fine taxonomy of coccoid green microalgae, though a careful spectrum region selection is needed.;[de Moraes, Guilherme Pavan| Augusto Henriques Vieira, Armando] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Bot, Lab Phycol, BR-13560 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil;de Moraes, GP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Bot, Lab Phycol, BR-13560 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;gpdemoraes@gmail.com;;;Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao PauloFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2011/50054-4]| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Msc Scolarship;This research was supported by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo, Grant Number 2011/50054-4, http://www.fapesp.br/ and Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Msc Scolarship, http://www.capes.gov.br/.

Binding of Cd(II) and Zn(II) was studied in seawater (pH 8.2) by additions of either single metallic species or binary mixtures. Computation of metal concentrations considered the cell-metal aggregates as slow diffusing. Adsorption capacities and conditional equilibrium constants were 2.9 +/- 0.3 mu mol g(-1) and 6.9 +/- 0.3 L g(-1) for Cd(II) and 18.5 +/- 0.9 mu mol g(-1) and 8.8 +/- 0.2 L g(-1) for Zn(II), respectively. For titrations with binary mixtures of Cd(II) and Zn(II), the adsorption capacity of Cd(II) decreased to 0.14 +/- 0.01 mu mol g(-1) and that for Zn(II) to 15.9 +/- 1.1 mu mol g(-1). The results suggest that binding of Zn(II) inhibits that of Cd(II). Under conditions of depleted Zn(II), the alga surface binds Cd(II), a process that can lead to bioaccumulation.;[Maguerroski, Kamila dos Santos| Rigobello-Masini, Marilda| Masini, Jorge C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, BR-05513970 Sao Paulo, Brazil;Masini, JC (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Quim, CP 26077, BR-05513970 Sao Paulo, Brazil.;jcmasini@iq.sup.br;Rigobello-Masini, Marilda/ABF-3919-2020| Masini, Jorge Cesar/C-9069-2012;Rigobello-Masini, Marilda/0000-0001-5402-441X| Masini, Jorge Cesar/0000-0002-0496-9009;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [475554/2009-4, 304178/2009-8];Authors are grateful to Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) for the financial support (Grants 475554/2009-4 and 304178/2009-8).;;41;1;1;0;21;SOC BRASILEIRA QUIMICA;SAO PAULO;CAIXA POSTAL 26037, 05599-970 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL;0103-5053;;;J BRAZIL CHEM SOC;J.

BSM with biogas/air mixture (10% CO2) injection on the 8th day led to of 13,257 +/- 430 x 10(4) cell mL(-1), and 2.0 +/- 0.16 g L-1 dry biomass with a 26% lipid content, which was approximately 70% higher than with air. After microalgae purification, biogas at the PBR outlet averaged 91% v/v CH4. In terms of bioenergy: i) the biogas lower heating value (LHV) increased from 22,554 to 33,294 kJ m(-3) (47.6%) with BSM, and similarly with BCM and BDS| ii) lipid content was increased, and iii) biohydrogen production is expected to increase from the PBR. For wastewater bioremediation, the microalgae Tetradesmus obliquus were able to remove 99.3% of ammonia and 99.2% of phosphorus concentration from BSM. There was a 96% BOD (628 mg L-1 to 23.3 mg L-1) and 91% COD reduction (1262 mg L-1 to 132 mg L-1). There was a 70% increase in biomass production and up to 4-fold lipid content increase with the procedure in comparison to air injection. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

For that, Phaeodactylum tricornutum was grown for 18 and 20 days in modified F2 medium which was supplied in the beginning of the culture, and with daily addition of glycerol (0.1 M) or glucose (0.05 M)| salinity at 15 and 30 parts per thousand, with the luminosity of 165 mmols photons m(-2)s(-2) for 24 h day(-1) or partial 12 h day(-1). Biomass production was registered, total lipids quantified with the Bligh and Dyer methodology, and the lipids' drops observed with Nile Red staining. Regarding salinity, a value of 15 parts per thousand led to the highest microalgae growth. Glycerol 0.1 M was the carbon source which provided the best assimilation by the microalgae, reaching up to 1.3 g L-1 of biomass. The 24 h -illu-mination photoperiod with glycerol in mixotrophic cultivation led to 338.97 mg L-1 of lipids, which was roughly 80% higher than the lipid content obtained with autotrophic growth.

SMX and other antibiotics can be considered as environmental contaminants of emerging concern. Due to their toxicity effects and their potential for the development of bacterial resistance their presence in aquatic compartment becomes a threat to human health. This study evaluated the bioremediation of SMX in WWTP effluents using a tertiary treatment composed by microalgae-bacteria consortium under low intensity artificial LED illumination, and also the assessment of sulfonamide resistance gene (still). The removal of SMX from WWTP effluents were 54.34 +/- 2.35%, in which the microalgae-bacteria consortium improves the removal performance of SMX. The main process of SMX removal can be attributed to the symbiotic biodegradation by bacteria due to the increase of oxygen released by the microalgae photosynthetic process. Therefore, the microalgae-bacteria consortium used in this study, demonstrated to be a promising alternative for bioremediation of SMX, with potential for removal others contaminants from wastewater effluent. However, the residual SMX and the relative abundance of antibiotics resistance genes (ARC) found in this study suggest that SMX contributes to selective pressure for ARG maintenance and proliferation in WWTP effluent. Thus, further studies to removal ARG from WWTP effluent are needed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Marandu| Dairy cattle| Resource recovery| Circular economy;WASTE-WATER TREATMENT| RATE ALGAL PONDS| NUTRIENT RECOVERY;The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of fertilization of a marandu grass pasture with microalgae biomass produced during the treatment of a wastewater from a dairy farm as a nitrogen source. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with three treatments (C - without fertilization, Q - chemical fertilization, and B - biological fertilization) with seven replications. The microalgae biomass considered in biological fertilization showed 1,992 mgL(-1) of phosphorus, 1,657 mgL(-1) of nitrogen and pH 8.4. The accumulated dry mass productivity was highest in chemical treatment Q (15,551 kgha(-1)), followed by B (14,857 kgha(-1)). Regarding the dry matter content, B stood out, with 23%, followed by C (21%). For crude protein (CP) and ash contents, Q presented the highest values (12.81 and 8.71%, respectively), followed by B (10.27 and 7.17%, respectively for CP and mineral matter content). The lowest neutral detergent fiber content was observed in Q (62.55%), followed by B (62.85%). The biological treatment had similar plant productivity compared to the treatment with chemical conventional fertilizer. Regarding nitrogen utilization efficiency and nitrogen recovery, chemical treatment showed statistical difference compared to microalgae biomass.

For this, three harvesting methods were evaluated and compared, namely the gravitational sedimentation (GS) via settling tank, coagulation with tannin followed by gravitational sedimentation (TC/GS), and a biofilm reactor operated in parallel with a settling tank (BR/GS). TC/GS required less time to concentrate the biomass (121.13 g/day)| however, the biomass had a higher moisture content (99.02%), which may compromise its direct application for production of most bioproducts and bioenergy, only a dewatering step is recommended. The harvesting methods interfered in biomass characterisation, mainly in carbohydrate content, which was higher in biomass concentrated over time (28-37%) than biomass concentrated in a single day by coagulation (13.8%). The results of the life cycle assessment revealed that in scenarios which included TC/GS methods and the BR/GS presented less environmental impact in relation to only GS. Additionally, the combination of these two methods comprises the best scenario and promises to optimise the harvest of biomass grown in wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to evaluate the cultivation of microalgae isolated from the Brazilian Northeast region (Lagerheimia longiseta, Monoraphidium contortum, and Scenedesmus quadricauda) in an alternative medium of low cost (biocompost of discarded fruits and vegetables) with a view to possible applications in the food industry. Microalgae cultivated in the conventional synthetic medium was used as control. The cultivation of microalgae in the alternative medium allowed suitable cell growth, and improved the antioxidant activity and the levels of monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid compared to the synthetic medium. The cultivation of S. quadricauda and L. longiseta species in the alternative medium resulted in increased protein content and/or total phenolic content, and improved health indices (lower levels of atherogenic, thrombogenic, and hypercholesterolemic saturated fatty acids indices, and higher levels of desired fatty acids index) compared to cultivation in synthetic medium. The cultivation of M. contortum in the alternative medium contributed to the production of higher lipid content, mainly saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid), which contributed negatively to the health indices. This study proved that S. quadricauda and L. longiseta microalga species from freshwaters have significant potential for distinct applications in functional food industries, and the biocompost of discarded fruits and vegetables is a suitable medium for microalgae cultivation.;[de Medeiros, Viviane Priscila Barros| Pedrosa, Geany Targino de Souza| Magnani, Marciane] Univ Fed Paraiba, Lab Proc Microbianos Alimentos LPMA, Ctr Tecnol, Campus I, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil| [Pimentel, Tatiana Colombo] Inst Fed Parana, Campus Paranavai, BR-87703536 Paranavai, Parana, Brazil| [Varandas, Roberta Conceicao Ribeiro| Sassi, Cristiane Francisca da Costa] Univ Fed Paraiba, Lab Ambientes Recifais & Biotecnol Microalgas LAR, Ctr Ciencias Exatas & Nat, Campus I, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil| [dos Santos, Silvana Alves] Empresa Paraibana Abastecimento & Serv Agr EMPASA, BR-58071000 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil| [da Conceica, Marta Maria] IDEP, Dept Tecnol Alimentos, Ctr Tecnol & Desenvolvimento Reg, BR-58058600 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil;Magnani, M (corresponding author), Univ Fed Paraiba, Lab Proc Microbianos Alimentos LPMA, Ctr Tecnol, Campus I, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil.;magnani2@pq.cnpq.br;Magnani, Marciane/P-4265-2016;Magnani, Marciane/0000-0002-7771-0479;Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES-Brazil)CAPES [001]| MCTI/FINEP [255709]| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq-Brazil)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [407519/2013-0];The authors would like to thank Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES-Brazil) and MCTI/FINEP for financial support (Code #001 and Process: 255709 respectively), and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq-Brazil, Process: 407519/2013-0) and Empresa Paraibana de Abastecimento e Servicos Agricolas (EMPASA) for the donation of the horticultural biocompost.;;52;0;0;1;1;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0963-9969;1873-7145;;FOOD RES INT;Food Res.

Cultures under photoautotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic nutritional modes were conducted in fed-batch and the lipids from the different biomasses were extracted and quantified. Then, the biomasses without lipids were used to feed the microcrustacean Daphnia similis. The results indicated the mixotrophic nutritional mode as the most suitable for the production of biomass (8.27 +/- 0.70 g L-1) and lipids (32.02 +/- 0.11%). In contrast, biomass from the heterotrophic nutritional mode was the most promising for feeding D. similis after lipid extraction (2370 +/- 372 Daphnia L-1). The integrated chain developed for biodiesel and aquatic feed is a promising alternative to produce energy with ultra-low environmental impact.;[Oliveira, Carlos Yure B.| Galvez, Alfredo O.] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Lab Prod Alimento Vivo, Dept Pesca & Aquicultura, Recife, PE, Brazil| [Oliveira, Carlos Yure B.| Nader, Camila| Lopes, Rafael G.| Derner, Roberto B.] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Lab Cult Algas, Dept Aquicultura, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [Silva, Maria F.

In this study, solutions fortified with albendazole (ABZ), fenbendazole (FBZ), and thiabendazole (TBZ) were subjected to photoperoxidation (UV/H2O2). The hydroxyl radicals generated by the process removed up to 99% of ABZ, and FBZ, in the highest dosage of H2O2 (i.e., 1.125 mmol L-1| 4.8 kJ L-1). In contrast, 20% of initial TBZ concentration remained in the residual solution. In the first 5 min of reaction (i.e., up to 0.750 mmol L-1 of H2O2), formation of the primary metabolites of ABZ-ricobendazole (RBZ), albendazole sulfone (ABZ-SO2), and oxfendazole (OFZ)-was observed. However, these reaction products were converted after the reaction time was doubled. The residual ecotoxicity was investigated using the Raphidocelis subcapitata microalgae and the marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri. The results for both microorganisms evidence that the residual solutions are less harmful to these microorganisms. However, after 30 min of reaction, the treated solution still presents a toxic effect for V. fischeri, meaning that longer reaction times are required to achieve an innocuous effluent.;[Venancio, Wilson Augusto Lima| Spina, Mylena| Diniz, Vinicius| Guimaraes, Jose Roberto] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Civil Engn Architecture & Urban Design, POB 6021, BR-13083889 Campinas, SP, Brazil| [Rodrigues-Silva, Caio] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Chem, Dept Analyt Chem, SP POB 6154, BR-13084971 Campinas, SP, Brazil;Guimaraes, JR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Civil Engn Architecture & Urban Design, POB 6021, BR-13083889 Campinas, SP, Brazil.| Rodrigues-Silva, C (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Chem, Dept Analyt Chem, SP POB 6154, BR-13084971 Campinas, SP, Brazil.;mr.caito@gmail.com| jorober.fec@gmail.com;| Silva, Caio/D-7652-2013;Diniz, Vinicius/0000-0002-2108-7702| Silva, Caio/0000-0002-3367-7144;Brazilian agency: The Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP, BRAZILFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/09543-7, 2018/03571-2]| Brazilian agency: The Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP, BRAZIL (INCTAA-FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2014/50951-4]| Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)CAPES| National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [154061/2018-2];This study is funded by the Brazilian agencies: The Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP, BRAZIL (grants #2013/09543-7, #2018/03571-2, and INCTAA-FAPESP #2014/50951-4).

Ecotoxicity of the raw, biotreated, and disinfected wastewater against the microalgaeScenedesmussp. was evaluated in short-term tests, while the potential of the microalgae as a nutrient removal step was addressed in long-term experiments. Throughout 5 operational phases, the biological system was subjected to gradual reduction of the hydraulic retention time (8-1.5 day), increasing the organic (0.21-1.11 kgCOD center dot m(-3)center dot day(-1)) and nitrogen (0.05-0.28 kgN center dot m(-3)center dot day(-1)) loading rates. COD and total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) removal ranged within 83%-97% and 83%-99%, respectively. While providing alkalinity source, effluent TAN concentrations were below 5 mg center dot L-1. Nitrate was the main nitrification product, while nitrite levels remained low (<1 mgN center dot L-1). Upon supplementation of external COD as ethanol, total nitrogen removal reached up to 90% at the highest load (0.28 kgN center dot m(-3)center dot day(-1)). After UV-C treatment, 3-log reduction of total coliforms was attained. The 96-hr ecotoxicity tests showed that all non-diluted samples tested (raw, biologically treated and UV-C irradiated wastewater) were toxic to microalgae. Nevertheless, these organisms were able to acclimate and grow under the imposed conditions, allowing to achieve nitrogen and phosphorous removal up to 99.1% and 43.0%, respectively. Practitioner points The treatment of a slaughterhouse wastewater in an anoxic-aerobic biological system followed by a UV-C disinfection step was assessed. The pre-denitrification system showed efficient simultaneous removal of organic matter and nitrogen from the wastewater under increasing applied loads. UV-C disinfection worked effectively in reducing coliforms from the biotreated effluent, boosting the performance of microalgae on nutrients removal. Despite the toxicity to microalgae, they were capable to acclimate to the aqueous matrices tested, reducing efficiently the nutrients content. The combined stages of treatment presented great capacity for depleting up to 97% COD, 99% nitrogen, and 43% phosphorous.;[Svierzoski, Nicoly Dal Santo| Mahler, Claudio Fernando] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Civil Engn Program, COPPE, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil| [Matheus, Mauricio Carvalho| Bassin, Joao Paulo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Chem Engn Program, COPPE, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil| [Brito, Yves Dias| Webler, Alberto Dresch] Fed Univ Rondonia, Dept Environm Engn, Rondonia, Brazil;Bassin, JP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Chem Engn Program, COPPE, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.| Svierzoski, ND (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Civil Engn Program, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;nicolydalsanto@gmail.com| jbassin@peq.coppe.ufrj.br;;Dias Brito, Yves/0000-0002-3789-9246| Matheus, Mauricio/0000-0002-0638-0230| Mahler, Claudio/0000-0002-3982-0001| Dresch Webler, Alberto/0000-0001-5777-2982| Svierzoski, Nicoly/0000-0002-2144-2292;;;;72;0;0;5;5;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-4303;1554-7531;;WATER ENVIRON RES;Water Environ.

This study aimed to evaluate if electroflocculation biomass harvesting altered the antioxidant properties and toxicity of methanol extracts from the marine microalgaeIsochrysis galbanaandPhaeodactylum tricornutum, compared with the traditional centrifugation approach. Analyses were based on the elimination of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical by the active ingredients from the extracts, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), calculation of IC50, and extract toxicity.Phaeodactylum tricornutumhad similar DPPH-reactive fractions (with antioxidant activity) different from the beta-carotene control in the TLC for both biomass-separating methods, but its IC(50)was 63% higher for electroflocculation (lower antioxidant activity). Bands with antioxidant activity were absent in the TCL ofI. galbana(non-DPPH-reactive) for both harvesting methods. The extracts did not present mortality for the study with theArtemia salinamodel. Therefore, electroflocculation can produce up to 10 times more biomass without cytotoxicity output but may decrease the antioxidant potential of microalgae extracts.;[Ramos, Luciana C.| Carneiro, Diego C.| Sousa, Leandro J.| Sales, Ayna N.| Lima, Suzana T.

Ozone concentrations (without ozone, 0.13 and 0.25 mg O-3/mg of biomass) and tannin dosages (65, 85 and 105 mg/L) were evaluated regarding microalgae separation and their influences on wastewater treatment performance. During the experiments, it was verified that the treatment efficiency increased when ozone was applied and with higher tannin dosages. The best results were found with 0.13 mg O-3/mg of biomass and 105 mg/L of tannin, obtaining excellent removal of turbidity removal (99.4%), apparent colour at 420 nm (94.5%), TN (83.2%), N-NH3(100%), TOC (86.8%), BOD5(86.5%) and COD (100%), 47.6% reduction in electric conductivity, 46.1% in TDS, 66.4% TP removal for the integrated system and 84% microalgae biomass recovery were obtained. Our results showed that the system proved to be a viable alternative for the treatment of urban wastewater and the recovery of microalgae through the insertion of ozone via Venturi tube combined with tannin-based agent.;[Oliveira, Gislayne Alves| Rodrigues, Lucia Ribeiro] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Recursos Hidr & Saneamento Ambie, Av Bento Goncalves, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil| [Machado, Enio Leandro] Univ Santa Cruz do Sul, Dept Quim & Fis, Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil| [Knoll, Rhauani Segatto] Univ Santa Cruz do Sul, Dept Engn Arquitetura & Ciencias Agr, Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil| [Dell'Osbel, Naira| Colares, Gustavo Stolzenberg] Univ Santa Cruz do Sul, Programa Posgrad Tecnol Ambientais, Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil;Oliveira, GA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Recursos Hidr & Saneamento Ambie, Av Bento Goncalves, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.;gislaynealvesoliveira@gmail.com;Colares, Gustavo/U-6513-2018| Machado, Enio Leandro/H-5120-2013;Colares, Gustavo/0000-0002-6354-3913| Alves Oliveira, Gislayne/0000-0001-5407-9496| Machado, Enio Leandro/0000-0003-0140-4966;Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)CAPES;Gislayne Alves Oliveria thanks the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES) for the post-doctoral fellowship that generated this work.

Currently, there is a tendency to identify locations with suitable climates for the large-scale implementation of microalgae-based processes. Therefore, this study proposed to map the performance of photobioreactors for microalgae culture. Fourteen types of climates distributed in 33 geographical locations representative of the equatorial and tropical zones of the world were evaluated. The simulated climatic elements were solar irradiation, temperature and photoperiod. RESULTS The results showed that the tropical with dry winter (Aw), tropical with dry summer (As), tropical monsoon (Am), tropical fully humid (Af), hot steppe (BSh) and hot desert (BWh) climates favored the system productivities. The highest biomass productivity (0.347 g L-1 d(-1)) and lipid (0.048 g L-1 d(-1)) were registered in the Aw simulation. CONCLUSION The results of this study provide a useful database of the effects of climate for the microalgae photoautotrophic production.

TCL sections were cultivated in MS/2 medium containingM. gracileextract (EM) and biomass (BM)|C. vulgarisextract (EC) and biomass (BC)| and BAP, TDZ, and ZEA in different concentrations. Subsequently, the explants were grown in MS/2 medium, with 2 g L(-1)of activated charcoal, to induce elongation and roots formation. For acclimatization, plants were transplanted in trays usingSphagnumsp. as substrate. TCL explants showed a higher formation of protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) than entire protocorms. Explants cultivated in media supplemented with BM showed a high rate of PLB regeneration (59%) and high mean number of PLBs (4 per explant) and 85% survival after acclimatization of the plants. Supplementation with BAP stimulated similar morphogenic responses to those observed with BM and superior results obtained with ZEA and TDZ. Mass propagation ofC. labiataplants was successfully achieved using TCL, and it is recommended to supplement the MS/2 medium with 4 g L(-1)of BM or 4 mg L(-1)of BAP.

Anaerobic digestion for biogas and biomethane production is the most straightforward and applicable technology for bioenergy recovery. However, pretreatment techniques may be needed to enhance the anaerobic biodegradability of microalgae. To date, very few full-scale systems have been put through, due to acknowledged bottlenecks such as low biomass concentration after conventional harvesting and inefficient processing into valuable products. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anaerobic digestion of pretreated microalgal biomass in a demonstration-scale microalgae biorefinery, and to compare the results obtained with previous research conducted at lab-scale, in order to assess the scalability of this bioprocess. In the lab-scale experiments, real municipal wastewater was treated in high rate algal ponds (2 x 0.47 m(3)), and harvested microalgal biomass was thickened and digested to produce biogas. It was observed how the methane yield increased by 67% after implementing a thermal pretreatment step (at 75 degrees C for 10 h), and therefore the very same pretreatment was applied in the demonstration-scale study. In this case, agricultural runoff was treated in semi-closed tubular photobioreactors (3 x 11.7 m(3)), and harvested microalgal biomass was thickened and thermally pretreated before undergoing the anaerobic digestion to produce biogas. The results showed a VS removal of 70% in the reactor and a methane yield up to 0.24 L CH4/g VS, which were similar to the lab-scale results. Furthermore, photosynthetic biogas upgrading led to the production of biomethane, while the digestate was treated in a constructed wetland to obtain a biofertilizer. In this way, the demonstration-scale plant evidenced the feasibility of recovering resources (biomethane and biofertilizer) from agricultural runoff using microalgae-based systems coupled with anaerobic digestion of the microalgal biomass.;[Diez-Montero, Ruben| Vassalle, Lucas| Ortiz, Antonio| Jesus Garcia-Galan, Maria| Garcia, Joan| Ferrer, Ivet] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, GEMMA Grp Environm Engn & Microbiol, BarcelonaTech, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Bldg D1, Barcelona 08034, Spain| [Vassalle, Lucas| Passos, Fabiana] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Sanit & Environm Engn, Av Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil;Ferrer, I (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, GEMMA Grp Environm Engn & Microbiol, BarcelonaTech, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Bldg D1, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;ruben.diez.montero@upc.edu| lucas.vassalle@upc.edu| fabiana@desa.ufmg.br| antonio.ortiz.ruiz@upc.edu| chus.garcia@upc.edu| joan.garcia@upc.edu| ivet.ferrer@upc.edu;Passos, Fabiana/L-1432-2016;Passos, Fabiana/0000-0001-7501-988X| Garcia, Joan/0000-0003-1258-8174;European Commission (H2020 project INCOVER)European Commission [GA 689242]| Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (MCIU) [RTI2018-099495-B-C21]| European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) (AL4BIO project)European Union (EU) [RTI2018-099495-B-C21]| Generalitat de Catalunya (Consolidated Research Group)Generalitat de Catalunya [2017 SGR 1029]| Research National Agency (AEI) [RTI2018-099495-B-C21];This research was funded by the European Commission (H2020 project INCOVER, GA 689242)| the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (MCIU), Research National Agency (AEI), and European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) (AL4BIO project, RTI2018-099495-B-C21)| and the Generalitat de Catalunya (Consolidated Research Group 2017 SGR 1029).;;43;0;0;1;1;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;OCT;2020;13;20;;;;;;;5484;10.3390/en13205484;;;17;Energy & Fuels;Energy & Fuels;OM7JX;WOS:000586197200001;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-01-01

The whole dried biomass production by Chlorella vulgaris and Arthrospira platensis were evaluated under different cultivation configurations. Besides, pigments such as beta-carotene, astaxanthin, and phycocyanin, by Dunaliella Haematococcus pluvialis, and Arthrospira platensis, respectively, were also subjected to environmental analysis, as well as docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids by Crypthecodinium cohnii, Nitzschia laevis, and Nannochloropsis oculata. These products were estimated by midpoint indicators through the nine impact categories and subsequently submitted to the normalization stage. Also, environmental critical points of the process were identified and discussed, focusing on the combined operations of dehydration and drying of biomass, as well as the central role of the energy footprint and the challenges of the transition from fossil energy to renewable matrices. Among the results found for whole dried biomass, the parameters that most influence the burdens are directly related to the energy requirements of the downstream processes. In intracellular microalgal products, the extraction stage and yield of the compounds are factors that most affect environmental performance. Additionally, this work provides quantitative numbers of sustainability indicators for microalgae projects considering the current stage of the technology. Therefore, the results found in this study are the first step found in the literature to identify environmental improvements in the consolidated biotechnological routes of microalgae.;[Depra, Mariany C.| Severo, Ihana A.| dos Santos, Aline M.| Zepka, Leila Q.| Jacob-Lopes, Eduardo] Univ Fed Santa Maria, UFSM, Bioproc Intensificat Grp, Roraima Ave 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil;Jacob-Lopes, E (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Maria, UFSM, Bioproc Intensificat Grp, Roraima Ave 1000, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.;ejacoblopes@gmail.com;Severo, Ihana Aguiar/AAY-9529-2020;Severo, Ihana Aguiar/0000-0001-5429-6052;National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) - BrazilNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)CAPES [001];The authors would like to thank the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) - Brazil, and the Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), Finance Code 001.;;108;0;0;7;7;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2211-9264;;;ALGAL RES;Algal Res.;OCT;2020;51;;;;;;;;102056;10.1016/j.algal.2020.102056;;;15;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;NZ2YH;WOS:000576964100001;;;;;2021-01-01

It can be cultivated in sewage, avoiding costs associated with clean water and nutrients, making the possibility of energy generation from wastewater treatment plants appealing. Compact microgeneration systems involving biomass gasifiers are already commercialized for small-scale projects and could be adapted for use with microalgae in wastewater. In this study, an experimental investigation of a commercial downdraft gasifier was conducted using microalgae produced in a wastewater treatment plants. The effects of the air-fuel equivalence ratio on syngas composition, higher heating value, and production rates were evaluated. An increasing and then decreasing trend in equivalence ratio with a peak was observed, indicating that the optimum equivalence ratio for the best performance is 0.23. The cold gas efficiency was 87%, higher heating value was 6.2 MJ/Nm(3), and the production rate was 2.8 Nm(3)/kg dry biomass. The syngas composition was 11.9% H2, 19.5% CO, 8.5% CxHy, and 9.8% CO2. The H-2/CO ratio observed in the syngas was 0.61, which is very close to the 0.60 recommended for synthetic fuel production (Fischer-Tropsch gasoline and diesel).;[Soares, Renan Barroso| Goncalves, Ricardo Franci] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Environm Engn, Ave Fernando Ferrari 514, BR-29075910 Vitoria, ES, Brazil| [Soares, Renan Barroso] Fed Inst Educ Espirito Santo, Ave Min Salgado Filho 1000, BR-29106010 Vila Velha, ES, Brazil| [Soares, Renan Barroso| Martins, Marcio Ferreira] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Lab Combust & Combustible Matter LCCm, PPGEM, Ave Fernando Ferrari 514, BR-29075910 Vitoria, ES, Brazil;Martins, MF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Lab Combust & Combustible Matter LCCm, PPGEM, Ave Fernando Ferrari 514, BR-29075910 Vitoria, ES, Brazil.;marcio.martins@ufes.br;;;National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| State of Espirito Santo Research Foundation (FAPES)| Project and Study Funding Agency (FINEP) (CHAMADA PUBLICA MCT/FINEP -ACAO TRANSVERSAL, BRAZIL) [01.06.0593.00];The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by the following agencies that support scientific and technological development in the country: National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), State of Espirito Santo Research Foundation (FAPES) and Project and Study Funding Agency (FINEP) (Grant Number: 01.06.0593.00 -CHAMADA PUBLICA MCT/FINEP -ACAO TRANSVERSAL, BRAZIL).

Microalgae are highly effective in nutrient recovery and have strong potential as a sustainable wastewater treatment technology. Here, nutrients from black water (toilet wastewater) were recovered as microalgal biomass, which was dried and assessed as a fertilizer in pot experiments compared with inorganic fertilizer. We deciphered the effects of microalgal biomass as a biofertilizer on plant growth and quality and the biological processes linked to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, we elucidated the assembly of the active microbiome in bulk soil and rhizosphere during barley development. Microalgal biomass application and inorganic fertilizer (NPK) resulted in similar plant productivity (16.6 g pot(-1)). Cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were 4.6-fold higher in the treatment amended with microalgal fertilizer (3.1% of applied N) than that with inorganic fertilizer (0.5% of applied N). Nitrification by bacteria was likely the main pathway responsible for N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.7, p < 0.001). The application of nitrogen fertilizers affected the structures of both the active bacterial and protozoan communities, but these effects were less obvious than the strong plant effect, as the recruited microbiota varied among different plant developmental stages. Both treatments enriched similar bacterial and protozoan taxonomic orders but with different distributions through time across the plant developmental stages. Furthermore, the bacterial community showed a clear trend of resilience from the beginning of the experiment until harvest, which was not observed for protozoa.

In the present study, we evaluated the changes in growth, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic parameters, and lipid and fatty acid (FA) contents of the freshwater microalgaSelenastrum gracile(Chlorophyceae) exposed to sublethal concentrations of cadmium for 72 h. Our results show that Cd negatively affected algal growth and chlorophyllaincreased per cell under Cd exposure. Photosynthetic parameters (maximum and operational yield, as well as quenching) were affected under Cd exposure, indicating damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. The amount of lipids and fatty acids increased with the increase of Cd in the medium. The most affected lipid classes under metal exposure were aliphatic hydrocarbon (HC), acetone mobile polar lipid (AMPL), and phospholipid (PL). Based on our results, we suggest that the production of algal lipids and fatty acids changed as a response to the amount of metal in the medium, avoiding photosynthetic damage at the lowest Cd concentration with the increase of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). However, at higher concentrations, the maintenance of the high values of PUFA was not observed and there was a decrease in the unsaturation of FA, resulting in higher amounts of MUFA. In addition, the percentage of structural lipids (sterol-ST-and PL) also decreased at the highest concentration. This, in combination with the decreased unsaturation of FA, suggests changes in membrane conformation and, consequently, damage to the photosynthetic machinery in the presence of Cd.;[Rocha, Giseli Swerts| Espindola, Evaldo L.

These compounds can be found in water due to runoff from agricultural, industrial and domestic applications. In Southern Brazil, tobacco cultivation is one of the most important economic agricultural activities. The bifenthrin pesticide, classified as having moderate toxicity (class II), is commonly used as an insecticide in this culture. In this context, the present research aimed to study the performance of microalgae-induced bioremediation processes. Microalgae were isolated from a natural water source in the city of Santa Cruz do Sul, RS, Brazil, which is an artificial reservoir used for public water supply. For this purpose, biodegradation, biosorption, influence of pH, percentage of inoculum and photoperiod were evaluated in batch experiments for 20 cultivation days. After the phycoremediation process, the bifenthrin pesticide (m/z = 181) was quantified by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results indicated that microalgae isolated from the water of the lake were able to contribute to the removal of approximately 99% of bifenthrin through biodegradation and biosorption processes. Photodegradation was identified (>77%) and the best condition for the phycoremediation was 20% inoculum with a photoperiod of 18:6 h.;[Weis, Leticia| de Cassia de Souza Schneider, Rosana| Hoeltz, Michele| Lobo, Eduardo A.] Univ Santa Cruz do Sul UNISC, Environm Technol Postgrad Program, Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil| [de Cassia de Souza Schneider, Rosana| Hoeltz, Michele| Rieger, Alexandre| Tostes, Schirley] Univ Santa Cruz do Sul, UNISC, Ctr Excellence Oilchem & Biotechnol, Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil;Schneider, RDD (corresponding author), Univ Santa Cruz do Sul UNISC, Environm Technol Postgrad Program, Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil.| Schneider, RDD (corresponding author), Univ Santa Cruz do Sul, UNISC, Ctr Excellence Oilchem & Biotechnol, Santa Cruz Do Sul, RS, Brazil.;rosana@unisc.br;Schneider, Rosana/A-1085-2013;Schneider, Rosana/0000-0003-1400-8401;Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)CAPES [001]| Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [309652/2016-2]| Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacao (MCTI) [01.0144.00/2010];This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001| by Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq) - Protocol Number 309652/2016-2 and by Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacao (MCTI) Agreement Number 01.0144.00/2010.;;27;0;0;1;1;IWA PUBLISHING;LONDON;ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND;0273-1223;1996-9732;;WATER SCI TECHNOL;Water Sci.

Among harvesting techniques, pH-induced sedimentation stands out as an inexpensive and technically viable method. Nevertheless, there is little information available on the application of this method for microalgae cultivated in wastewater. In this context, the present study investigated the optimization of sedimentation parameters forChlorella sorokinianaharvesting from wastewater. Parameter optimization was statistically determined by the response surface methodology. The optimal values included a velocity gradient of 250 s(-1), mixing time of 10 seconds, and pH of 12, which enabled microalgae harvesting efficiencies of more than 97.8%. These optimal parameters also showed resilience through the physico-chemical variation of the photobioreactor effluent. Furthermore, wastewater quality improved significantly after microalgae harvesting. High removal was found for turbidity (97.9-98.3%), apparent color (92.2-97.2%), total Kjeldhal nitrogen (91.0-94.4%), and total phosphorus (92.8-98.6%). Centrifugation, as the dewatering method, and its operational parameters were also evaluated. Sedimentation followed by centrifugation increased the initial microalgae concentration by about 123 times. This study shows the importance of operational optimization and the results can be used as practical guidelines for microalgae harvesting on a large scale.;[Leite, Luan de Souza| Daniel, Luiz Antonio] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Hydraul & Sanitat, Sao Carlos Sch Engn, Av Trabalhador Sao Carlense 400, BR-1356659 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil;Leite, LD (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Hydraul & Sanitat, Sao Carlos Sch Engn, Av Trabalhador Sao Carlense 400, BR-1356659 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;luanleite@usp.br;de Souza Leite, Luan/AAE-1225-2019;de Souza Leite, Luan/0000-0002-2108-2960;Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2013/50351-4, 2017/14620-1]| Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel-Brazil (CAPES)CAPES [001];This work was supported by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) for the research assistance [Proc. 2013/50351-4], Master's Grant [Proc. 2017/14620-1] and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel-Brazil (CAPES) [Finance Code 001].

A current challenge in algae farming is the real-time monitoring of biomass production to control parameters which are important to sustain a fast microalgae growth and high biomass productivity. Laboratory-scale methods developed for the determination microalgal biomass concentration lack the scalability required for monitoring large algae farms. Thus, this study proposes a low-cost and versatile sensor for real-time monitoring of the optical density of microalgae cultures in open and closed cultivation systems. The optical density unit of the sensor was based in ultraviolet and near-infrared wavelengths, and the validation of sensor measurements was performed correlating its response with a spectrophotometer. The sensor showed strong linearity and precisely measured the biomass concentration in dry weight basis (DW) in the range of 40-800 mg L-1 The sensor-based on multi-wavelengths was conceived with an automatic sampling unit that works continuously and neither requires manual intervention nor sample dilution. The proposed system is cheaper than usual devices used for microalgae biomass quantification and compatible with the Internet of Things concept, data loggers with RS-232, universal serial bus, and analog inputs.;[Barbosa, Ruben Christian| Soares, Jimmy| Martins, Marcio Aredes] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Agr Engn, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil;Martins, MA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Agr Engn, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.;aredes@ufv.br;;;Petroleo Brasileiro S/A [4600545175]| Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [307147/2015-0]| CNPq -BrazilNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [140609/2016-4, 155994/2018-2];We are thankful to Petroleo Brasileiro S/A for research funding (grant 4600545175), and the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, grant 307147/2015-0).

This study aims to perform a cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment of the industrial production of microalgal biodiesel, using an autochthonous Chilean Phaeodactylum tricornutum strain, considering 1 MJ of biodiesel as the functional unit. For the compilation of the Life Cycle Inventory, real experimental data were obtained from the pilot-scale cultivation in a photobioreactor (PBR) module located in the city of Concepcion, in Chile. The scale-up to the industrial plant considers that PBR modules are of the same size as those used in the pilot-scale. The Life Cycle Impacts Analysis considered the ReCiPe 2016 Endpoint (H) V1.00 method. Results show that the whole process contributes to a total of 5.74 kgCO(2)eq per MJ of biodiesel produced. PBR construction materials and energy consumption are the main contributors to the life cycle environmental impacts. The sensitivity analysis shows that energy consumption, water reuse and transportation distance of seawater from ocean to the industrial plant are the critical parameters that most affect the overall environmental performance of the system. The rate of water reuse is particularly critical to the global warming potential. Results also show that the valorization of co-products is an important aspect to improve the environmental performance of microalgal biodiesel production. Therefore, this study supports the decision-making process in biofuel production to promote the development of sustainable pilot and large-scale algae-based industry. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of wastewater as a source for recovery of carbon and nutrients is an attractive and sustainable alternative. In this study, anaerobically treated black water was treated in photobioreactors (PBRs) inoculated with Chlorella sorokiniana, and the process was investigated in terms of phosphorus and nitrogen removal, biomass growth, and the removal of pathogens. The consumption of bicarbonate (alkalinity) and acetate (volatile fatty acids) as carbon sources by microalgae was investigated. The average nutrient removal achieved was 66% for N and 74% for P. A high consumption of alkalinity (83%) and volatile organic acids (76%) was observed, which suggests that these compounds were used as a source of carbon. The biomass production was 73 mg L-1 day(-1), with a mean biomass of 0.7 g L-1 at the end of the batch treatment. At the end of the experiments, a log removal/inactivation of 0.51 log for total coliforms and 2.73 log for Escherichia coli (E. coli) was observed.

The microalgae used wereSpirulina platensisLEB-52,Chlorella homosphaera, andScenedesmus obliquus. The EPs used were paracetamol, diazepam, fluoxetine, acetylsalicylic acid, and caffeine, added to the cultures in concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 mg L-1. The tests were carried out in closed 150-mL Erlenmeyer bioreactors, containing standard medium from each microalga culture. Cell concentrations were determined every 24 h using optical density. Culture continued for 20 days. At the end of the growth, biomass was collected and used to measure carbohydrates, proteins, and enzymatic hydrolysis, to determine possible changes due to the presence of EPs. In general, microalgae resisted concentrations of up to 100 mg L(-1)of paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, and caffeine, 30 mg L(-1)of diazepam, and 1 mg L(-1)of fluoxetine.S. obliquuswas the most resistant strain, followed byC. homosphaeraandS. platensisLEB-52 being less resistant. Acetylsalicylic acid and caffeine influenced the content of carbohydrates and proteins in biomass, reaching values above 35% of carbohydrates forS. platensisLEB-52 and above 66% of proteins forS. obliquus. There was no influence of EPs in the enzymatic hydrolysis processes. Microalgae showed resistance to EP concentrations, thereby emerging as a promising wastewater bioremediation technology. These high levels of carbohydrates are of great value because they can be used in the production of bioethanol.;[Rempel, Alan| Colla, Luciane Maria] Univ Passo Fundo UPF, Grad Program Environm & Civil Engn, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil| [Nadal Biolchi, Gabrielle| Farezin Antunes, Ana Carolina| Gutkoski, Julia Pedo] Univ Passo Fundo UPF, Chem Engn Course, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil| [Treichel, Helen] Fed Univ Fronteira Sul, Campus Erechim, BR-99700000 Erechim, RS, Brazil;Colla, LM (corresponding author), Univ Passo Fundo UPF, Grad Program Environm & Civil Engn, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil.;alan.rempel@hotmail.com| gabbebiolchi@gmail.com| anacarolfarezin@gmail.com| 136213@upf.br| helentreichel@gmail.com| lmcolla@upf.br;Colla, Luciane/C-9230-2016;Colla, Luciane/0000-0001-9745-4452;;;;64;0;0;7;7;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1939-1234;1939-1242;;BIOENERG RES;BioEnergy Res.;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s12155-020-10177-w;;AUG 2020;13;Energy & Fuels| Environmental Sciences;Energy & Fuels| Environmental Sciences & Ecology;MS7FN;WOS:000554441400001;;;;;2021-01-01

Microalgae cultures are subject to failures in continuity| therefore, concentrated inocula could be used during episodes of crashes to reestablish the production of microalgae biomass. For this reason, the present work evaluated a concentrated inocula of the microalgaeNannochloropsis oculataharvested by flocculation and stored in a refrigerator with additives (vitamin C or citric acid) and without additives. Sensorial analysis (color and odor), protein content, cell integrity rate, cell resuspension rate, and culture growth parameters (maximum cell density and growth rate) were estimated for 15 weeks. The concentrates with citric acid presented an alteration in the color aspect at the 11(th)week of storage. No differences were seen in the protein content and cell integrity rates either between storage methods or storage weeks. In sum, the use of additives did not significantly influence the growth performance of any of the treatments, since their cells continued to reproduce throughout the entire trial period. In addition, the additives enhanced the cell resuspension rate of the concentrates. For that reason, the concentrated inoculum with vitamin C was selected as the best treatment.;[Sales, Rafael| de Souza-Santos, Lilia Pereira] Univ Fed Pernambuco UFPE, Dept Oceanog, Lab Cult & Ecotoxiool LACE, Recife, PE, Brazil| [Sales, Rafael] Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Dept Aquaculture, Admar Gonzaga Rd, BR-1346 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil;Sales, R (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco UFPE, Dept Oceanog, Lab Cult & Ecotoxiool LACE, Recife, PE, Brazil.| Sales, R (corresponding author), Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Dept Aquaculture, Admar Gonzaga Rd, BR-1346 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.;rafael_ojs@hotmail.com;SOUZA-SANTOS, LILIA P/I-1653-2012;Sales, Rafael/0000-0002-2235-8076;;;;37;0;0;12;12;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0967-6120;1573-143X;;AQUACULT INT;Aquac.

A synthetic medium with glucose (2 g center dot L-1) and mineral nutrients essential for both fungi and algae was selected. Four different inoculation strategies were assessed, considering the effect of simultaneous vs. separate development of fungal spores and algae cells, and the presence of a supporting matrix aiming at the higher recovery of algae cell rates. The results were evaluated in terms of consortium biomass composition, demonstrating that the strategy using a mature fungal mycelium with a higher algae count may provide biomass samples with up to 79% of their dry weight as algae, still promoting recovery rates greater than 97%. The findings demonstrate a synergistic effect on the lipid accumulation by the fungal strain, at around a fourfold increase when compared to the axenic control, with values in the range of 23% of dry biomass weight. Furthermore, the fatty acid profile from the samples presents a balance between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids that is likely to present an adequate balance for applications such as biodiesel production.;[Zorn, Savienne M.

This work demonstrates an efficient pilot-size photoautotrophic growth of the two strains using 40-L bubble-column photobioreactors, providing lipid productivities of around 15.2 and 8.7 mg L-1 day(-1) for C. minutissima and N. gaditana, respectively. The lipid-bearing biomass, which presented fatty acids composition similar to vegetable oils, such as soybean, rich in palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids, was then assayed in direct trans/esterification reactions using ethanol as acyl donor, lipid extracting and solvent for the liquid phase in a pressurized reactor. The reactions, which were catalyzed by a heterogeneous acid catalyst (12-molybdophosphoric acid supported onto aluminum oxide), demonstrated an efficient route for producing a product mixture containing ester contents greater than 96.5 wt%, total conversion of triacylglycerols, and low levels of mono- and diacylglycerols, promoting an ethyl ester mixture with possible integration within the biodiesel market specifications.;[Zorn, Savienne M.

In this sense, a sequential study to develop a kinetic model that could be applied and validated in similar random bioprocesses was made. For the contaminant removal, the n-th order kinetic model was the most efficient. On the other hand, for biomass production, the Monod (one limiting substrate) and Silva and the Cerqueira (multiple limiting substrates) models were considered efficient to describe wastewater treatment using COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand)/TOC (Total Organic Carbon), nitrogen and phosphorus content.

The use of microalgae for this purpose has attracted the attention of researchers because: (i) microalgae can assimilate phosphorus (one of the main nutrients for their growth)| and (ii) growing on effluents can significantly reduce the costs and environmental impact of microalgal biomass production. This study evaluated the growth and ability of Chlorella vulgaris to remove the phosphorus from a secondary-treated effluent of a Portuguese paper company. Batch experiments were performed for 11 days using different dilutions of the effluent to evaluate its inhibitory effect on microalgae. Results showed that the non-diluted effluent inhibited microalgal growth, indicating that this bioremediation process is possible after a previous dilution of the effluent. Regarding phosphorus removal, promising results were achieved, especially in the experiments conducted with the most diluted effluent: removal efficiencies obtained in these conditions were (54 +/- 1)%. Another interesting finding of this study was microalgal growth in flakes' form (mainly due to the compounds present in the effluent and to the pH values achieved), which can be an important economic advantage for biomass recovery after the remediation step.;[Porto, Bruna| Guelli Ulson de Souza, Selene M.

The bloom included a mix of microalgae with unresolved taxonomy and lasted for 7 months with a maximum concentration of 130 mu g chlorophyll a L-1. In 2012, brown tide Aureoumbra lagunensis also bloomed in portions of this estuary, with reoccurrences in 2016 and 2018. To identify and understand the role of grazer pressure (top-down control) on bloom formation, we coupled DNA sequencing with bivalve feeding assays using three microalgae isolated from the 2011 bloom and maintained in culture. Feeding experiments were conducted on widely distributed bivalve species in the lagoon, including eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), hooked mussels (Ischadium recurvum), charru mussels (Mytella charruana), green mussels (Perna viridis), Atlantic rangia (Rangia cuneata), and hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria), which were exposed to 3 x 10(4) cells mL(-1) of five species of microalgae consisting of A. lagunensis and the three species clarified herein, the picocyanobacteria Crocosphaera sp. and 'Synechococcus' sp., and the picochlorophyte Picochlorum sp., as well as Nannochloropsis oculata used as a control. To ensure clearance rates were indicative of consumption and assimilation, the microalgae were isotopically (N-15) labeled prior to feeding experiments. Clearance rates differed among bivalve and microalgal species, but enriched N-15 values in bivalve tissue suggest that algal bloom species were assimilated by the bivalves. These results expand our understanding of the important ecosystem services that healthy, biodiverse filter feeder communities provide.;[Galimany, Eve| Lunt, Jessica| Freeman, Christopher J.| Houk, Jay| Sauvage, Thomas| Santos, Larissa| Lunt, Jillian| Kolmakova, Maria| Mossop, Malcolm| Domingos, Arthur| Paul, Valerie J.] Smithsonian Marine Stn, 701 Seaway Dr, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USA| [Galimany, Eve] CSIC, Inst Marine Sci ICM, P Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain| [Lunt, Jessica] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA| [Freeman, Christopher J.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC 29424 USA| [Sauvage, Thomas] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Grad Program Ecol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil| [Phlips, Edward J.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, 7922 NW 71St St,POB 110600, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA;Galimany, E| Lunt, J (corresponding author), Smithsonian Marine Stn, 701 Seaway Dr, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USA.| Galimany, E (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Marine Sci ICM, P Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.| Lunt, J (corresponding author), Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA.;galimany@icm.csic.es| jlunt@disl.org;;Sauvage, Thomas/0000-0002-9169-6925;St. Johns River Water Management District [27799]| Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) [13051];We thank St. Johns River Water Management District (Contract 27799) and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC Agreement No. 13051) for funding the project.;;97;0;0;7;7;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1559-2723;1559-2731;;ESTUAR COAST;Estuaries Coasts;SEP;2020;43;6;;;;;1519;1532;;10.1007/s12237-020-00746-9;;APR 2020;14;Environmental Sciences| Marine & Freshwater Biology;Environmental Sciences & Ecology| Marine & Freshwater Biology;MO4YQ;WOS:000528321100002;;Other Gold, Green Published;;;2021-01-01

By using in vitro assays, the present study characterized the aqueous and alkaline extracts from microalgae Pavlova lutheri and Pavlova gyrans and evaluated the capacity of these extracts to adhere to enterobacteria (Salmonella Typhimurium). The aqueous and alkaline extracts of both species were fractionated via freeze-thawing, giving rise to soluble and insoluble (precipitate) fractions in cold water. The obtained fractions were studied using thermogravimetric, methylation analyses, and using 1D and 2D NMR techniques. The cold-water-soluble fractions obtained from the aqueous extracts were mainly composed of highly branched (1 -> 3),(1 -> 6)-beta-glucans, whereas the cold-water-precipitate fractions were constituted by (1 -> 3)-beta-glucans. The alkaline extract fractions showed similar compositions with a high protein content, and the presence of glycosides (sulfoquinovosylglycerol (SQG), digalactosylglycerol (DGG)), and free fatty acids. The linear (1 -> 3)-beta-glucans and the alkaline extract fractions showed an adhesion capacity toward Salmonella. The chemical composition of the active fractions suggested that the presence of three-linked beta-glucose units, as well as microalgal proteins and glycosides, could be important in the adhesion process. Therefore, these microalgal species possess a high potential to serve as a source of anti-adhesive compounds.;[Marques Machado, Tatiane Winkler| Moro, Tatiana Rojo] Fed Univ Parana UFPR, Postgrad Program Sci Biochem, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [Marques Machado, Tatiane Winkler| Rodrigues, Jenifer Mota| Moro, Tatiana Rojo| Rabello Duarte, Maria Eugenia| Noseda, Miguel Daniel] UFPR, Biochem & Mol Biol Dept, Av Cel Francisco H dos Santos 100,POB 19046, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [Rodrigues, Jenifer Mota] UFPR, Postgrad Program Bioproc & Biotechnol Engn, BR-81531990 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil;Duarte, MER| Noseda, MD (corresponding author), UFPR, Biochem & Mol Biol Dept, Av Cel Francisco H dos Santos 100,POB 19046, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.;tatiwinkler@gmail.com| jeni.mota.r@gmail.com| tatiana.rmoro@gmail.com| eugenia.duarte@pq.cnpq.br| mdn@ufpr.br;Noseda, Miguel D/I-6480-2013;Noseda, Miguel D/0000-0002-0724-1515| Mota Rodrigues, Jenifer/0000-0003-3154-6105;Brazilian agency: National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [485980/2012-6, 462414/2014-0]| Brazilian agency: Araucaria Foundation (PRONEX Carboidratos)| Brazilian agency: Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)CAPES [001];This work was supported by the Brazilian agencies: National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) (Universal Calls grant numbers: 485980/2012-6, 462414/2014-0)| Araucaria Foundation (PRONEX Carboidratos)| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Finance Code 001.;;73;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2076-3417;;APPL SCI-BASEL;Appl.

However, for its application an effective preservation technique must be developed. In this paper, we investigated the use of a non-conventional rotary dryer (with an inert bed) for drying the microalga Spirulina biomass and the effects of the operational conditions (air temperature, intermittent feeding interval, filling degree of inert particles, and rotation speed) on its bioactive compounds. The results indicated that this non-conventional drying system offers an effective alternative for expanding the use of this biomass in an adequate form. We identified the conditions in which the dried material had maintained satisfactory contents of phenolics (air temperature of 70 degrees C and intermittent feeding interval of 10 min), flavonoids (intermittent feeding interval of 17.4 min), and phycocyanin compounds (air temperature of 40 degrees C), which were near to those present in fresh microalga.;[Silva, Neiton C.| Duarte, Claudio R.| Barrozo, Marcos A.

EtBr ability of intercalating in the DNA molecule makes it a toxic substance. The objective was to evaluate the phycoremediation potentials of Chlorella vulgaris, Desmodesmus subspicatus and Raphidocelis subcapitata tested separately and in a mixture (Mix) for EtBr removal from the aqueous medium. Experiments were conducted using an initial algae biomass of 10(6) cell/mL, exposed to 500 mu g/L of EtBr. The removal efficiency (mu g EtBr L-1) after 3 h in each treatment were: Mix (72.8 mu g.L-1) >D. subspicatus (48.4 mu g.L-1) >R. subcapitata (24.6 mu g.L-1) >C. vulgaris (19.9 mu g.L-1). However, when EtBr mass reduction per microalgae density is considered (ng.algae(-1)), the efficiency ranking changes to: D. subspicatus (1.9 x 10(-5 )ng.algae(-1)) >C. vulgaris (1.4 x 10(-5 )ng.algae(-1)) >Mix (9.8 x 10(-6 )ng.algae(-1)) >R. subcapitata (2.8 x 10(-6 )ng.algae(-1)). The results suggest that initial algal population density is a determinant factor for efficient EtBr removal by microalgae species in short term treatments. In order to obtain 100% of EtBr removal, it should be necessary 10(10), 10(10) and 10(11) algae.mL(-1) of C. vulgaris, D. subspicatus and R. subcapitata, respectively. The results strongly suggest phycoremediation can be explored as an alternative method for EtBr removal.;[de Almeida, Heleno Cavalcante| de Sa Salomao, Andre Luis| Lambert, Janaina| Rocha Saraiva Teixeira, Lia Cardoso| Marques, Marcia] Rio de Janeiro State Univ UERJ, Dept Sanit & Environm Engn, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524,5024E, BR-20550900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil;Salomao, ALD (corresponding author), Rio de Janeiro State Univ UERJ, Dept Sanit & Environm Engn, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524,5024E, BR-20550900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;andre@andresalomao.com;Marques, Marcia/G-7739-2012;Marques, Marcia/0000-0002-7920-8001;Carlos Chagas Filho Research Support Foundation of Rio de Janeiro State FAPERJCarlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) [E-26/202.894/2018]| Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - CAPESCAPES [001]| National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [308.335/2017-1, 4358.83/2018-6, 436327/2018-0]| Financing Agency of Studies and Project - FINEP [Conv.01.14.0081.00];The authors acknowledge the financial support given by the Carlos Chagas Filho Research Support Foundation of Rio de Janeiro State FAPERJ (E-26/202.894/2018), by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - CAPES (Finance Code 001), by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq (308.335/2017-1| 4358.83/2018-6| 436327/2018-0) and by the Financing Agency of Studies and Project - FINEP (Conv.01.14.0081.00).;;42;0;0;1;2;TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC;PHILADELPHIA;530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA;1522-6514;1549-7879;;INT J PHYTOREMEDIAT;Int.

LEB 18 cultures. The use of MS for the CO2 supply in Spirulina cultures resulted not only in the increase of DIC concentrations but also in the highest accumulated DIC concentration in the liquid medium (127.4 mg L-1 d(-1)). The highest values of biomass concentration (1.98 g L-1), biomass productivity (131.8 mg L-1 d(-1)), carbon in biomass (47.9% w w(-1)), CO2 fixation rate (231.6 mg L-1 d(-1)), and CO2 use efficiency (80.5% w w(-1)) by Spirulina were verified with MS, compared to the culture with conventional sparger for CO2 supply. Spirulina biomass in both culture conditions had high protein contents varying from 64.9 to 69% (w w(-1)). MS can be considered an innovative system for the supply of carbon for the microalgae cultivation and biomass production. Moreover, the use of membrane system might contribute to increased process efficiency with a reduced cost of biomass production.;[Moraes, Luiza| da Rosa, Gabriel M.| Costa, Jorge A.

This model was developed considering the following: homogeneous cell volume and composition| cells agglomerate forming clusters during in situ reaction| the cluster is considered to be formed of internal and external regions| the species concentration in the cluster is described considering multicomponent Langmuir isotherm model| the fatty acids diffusion inside clusters is described by Fick's Law| mass transfer of the fatty acids between external solid and bulk phases is governed by convection| and reaction occurs homogenously in the bulk phase. Results show that the proposed model fits the experimental data and adequately describes the reaction kinetics and mass transfers between bulk and external solid phases as well as from internal to external solid phases. It was verified that ester production is higher in the initial period of reaction due to the greater availability of lipids, tending to achieve a maximum over time. The mass transfer coefficients values suggest that the alcohol moves towards the solid phase more hardly than the fatty acids are extracted to the bulk phase. Moreover, the Langmuir constants show that the alcohol has higher adsorption strength in the biomass than the esters.;[Branco, Kemely B. Z.

The different nitrogen forms that are present in aquaculture effluents are particularly concerning. This study demonstrated that the dinoflagellate Amphidinium carterae can acclimate to both combined and sole nitrogen sources such as nitrate, ammonium, and urea over a wide concentration range. As far as is known, it is the first time that a species of the genus Amphidinium has been successfully cultured with urea as the sole source of nitrogen. In the presence of 882 mu M of nitrate, A. carterae tolerated urea concentrations up to 5000 mu M. With respect to ammonium-N tolerance, it has been observed that it is lethal at concentrations higher than 441 mu M. A robust laboratory experimental design was critical for accurately assessing this acclimation. Alternative N sources did not affect the production of high-value specific polyketide secondary metabolites from A. carterae, such as amphidinols, with an average concentration of 0.435 +/- 0.038% biomass d.w. An analysis of the symbiotic microbial assemblages developed in a long-term A. carterae culture in an open raceway pond, and the fact that it is able to metabolize all three nitrogen sources simultaneously, supports the idea that this microalga has the potential to be successfully cultured with aquaculture effluents.;[Molina-Miras, A.| Lopez-Rosales, L.| Ceron-Garcia, M.

One way to achieve this goal in microalgae production is to optimize the factors that influence their growth during the cultivation stage to increase the accumulation of bio-compounds of interest. In this stage, the factors that most influence are: nutrition, gas diffusion, light intensity and quality and, finally, stirring, which directly affects all other factors. Thus, a review and an evaluation of the influence and importance of stirring were performed in the present study. The nutrients that most influence biomass accumulation are carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, but their proportion is directly related to the proposed objective for microalgas. In the diffusion of gases, it is essential to supply adequate CO2 for the growth of microalgae, and flue gases can be used. Also, it is necessary to ensure proper removal of photosynthetic O-2, which could inhibit microalgae metabolism and slow their growth rate. It is important to provide the appropriate light intensity for photosynthesis, but excess may cause photoinhibition in cultivation. Stirring is of paramount importance to ensure nutrient distribution in the medium, gas diffusion (incorporation of CO2 and removal of O-2) and adequate exposure of microalgae to light, reducing the effects of photoinhibition and self-shading.;[Pedruzi, Gerson O.

Therefore, this study was conducted (1) to identify and compare the toxic effects of MeP on physiological parameters of different green microalgae species, using suitable mathematical models| and (2) to estimate a PNEC value for MeP in freshwater ecosystems, adopting either the deterministic or the probabilistic approaches. Toxicity tests were carried out with three green microalgae (Pseudopediastrum boryanum, Desmodesmus communis, Raphidocelis subcapitata), in which different endpoints such as growth rate, chlorophyll-a, and cell viability were measured and compared through the effective concentration which caused a response in x% of test organisms (ECx). ECx were obtained by adjusting different non-linear regression models for each microalgae dataset. Chlorophyll-a endpoint resulted in the lowest EC50 values, respectively 125, 81.2, 18.3 mg L-1 for D. communis, P. boryanum and R. subcapitata, showing R. subicapitata as the most sensitive, and D. communis as the most tolerant species to MeP (P < 0.05). PNEC was estimated from the present study and previous reports resulting in 5.7 and 65 mu g L-1, respectively for the deterministic (PNECd) and the probabilistic (PNECp) approach. The development of chronic assays using test organisms from different ecological groups is encouraged to provide robust PNECp. In this meantime, we recommend the use of the estimated PNECd to support MeP risk assessments and policy formulation.;[Puerta, Yarin Tatiana| Martins, Samantha Eslava| Gaspar Martins, Camila de Martinez] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Programa Posgrad Biol Ambientes Aqudticos Contine, Ave Italia,Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil| [Guimaraes, Pablo Santos| Martins, Samantha Eslava| Gaspar Martins, Camila de Martinez] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Ciencias Biol, Ave Itdlia,Km 8,Carreiros, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil| [Puerta, Yarin Tatiana] Univ Antioquia, GeoLimna, Fac Engn, 67th St 53-108, Medellin, Colombia;Martins, SE (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande, Programa Posgrad Biol Ambientes Aqudticos Contine, Ave Italia,Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.;samanthamartins@furg.br;de Martinez Gaspar Martins, Camila/AAR-7061-2020;de Martinez Gaspar Martins, Camila/0000-0001-7084-9948;CAPESCAPES| State Sanitation Agency CORSAN [006/16 - DTEC];We are grateful to Larissa Carvalho and Luciana Carlosso for help with dataset survey, and Rubia Rodriguez for support in laboratory tests.

Growing microalgae on waste can be a means of its remediation and decrease culture costs. The physiological knowledge of microalgae on waste can generate subsidies to increase biomass productivity. However, few studies have explored the photosynthetic metabolism of microalgae on complex matrices such as vinasse. In the present research, we investigated some physiological aspects related to photosynthesis and growth of several microalgae in centrifuged and diluted vinasse. The species investigated were Chlamydomonas sp., Chlorella sorokiniana, Chlorella vulgaris, Desmodesmus spinosus, Haematococcus pluvialis, Monoraphidium sp., Scenedesmus quadricauda and Tetraselmis gracilis. Daily cell density, in vivo chlorophyll a and final cellular biovolumes (96 h) were monitored to infer about population growth. Maximum and operational photosynthetic yields (phi(M) and phi '(M)), photochemical (qP) and non-photochemical (NPQ) quenchings, light saturation curves and related parameters (alpha, rETR(m) and E-K), as well as theoretical carbon fixation were evaluated using pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry (PAM). The results showed that chlorophyll a, photochemical (qP) and non-photochemical (NPQ) quenchings were not affected in vinasse, but photosynthetic yields, light curves parameters and autotrophic carbon fixation decreased. Connecting these results to the increase in productivities in vinasse lead us to the rationale that mixotrophic metabolism was supporting microalgae growth on the waste. This study offers important insights into the understanding of microalgal photosynthetic physiology on complex organic wastes, generating subsidies for optimization of biotechnological use of vinasse related to microalgae production.;[Candido, Camila] Univ Fed Sao Carlos UFSCar, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Recursos Nat PPGERN, Lab Biotecnol Algas, Rod Washington Luis,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil| [Lombardi, Ana Teresa] Univ Fed Sao Carlos UFSCar, Dept Bot, Lab Biotecnol Algas, Rod Washington Luis,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil;Candido, C (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos UFSCar, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Recursos Nat PPGERN, Lab Biotecnol Algas, Rod Washington Luis,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;cacandido90@gmail.com;;Candido, Camila/0000-0002-1103-5693;Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES - Brasil)CAPES [001]| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq - Brasil)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [302175/2015-6]| Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de SAo Paulo (FAPESP - Brasil)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2018/07988-5];This study was financed by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES - Brasil, Finance Code 001), by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq - Brasil, Process 302175/2015-6) and by the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de SAo Paulo (FAPESP - Brasil, Process 2018/07988-5).;;42;0;0;6;8;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0959-3993;1573-0972;;WORLD J MICROB BIOT;World J.

P was provided in three concentrations: 2.3 x 10(-4) mol L-1, 2.3 x 10(-6) mol L(-1 )and 1.0 x 10(-6) mol L-1. Algal cells were acclimated to the specific P concentrations before the start of the experiment The chemical equilibrium software MINEQL(+) 4.61 was employed to calculate the Zn2+ concentration. After acclimated, the algal cells were inoculated into media containing different Zn concentrations (0.09 x 10(-6) mol L(-1 )to 9.08 x 10(-6) mol L-1). The study showed that besides the reduction in algal growth rates, phosphorus had an important influence on the toxicity of zinc for microalga. The inhibitory Zn2+ concentration values for R. subcapitata were 2.74 x 10(-6) mol L-1 0.58 x 10(-6) mol L-1 and 0.24 x 10(-6) mol L-1 for the microalgae acclimated at P concentrations of 2.3 x 10(-4) mol L-1, 2.3 x 10(-6) mol L-1 and 1.0 x 10(-6) mol L-1 respectively.

Canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) was used to identify the potential environmental drivers of microphytobenthic assemblage structure. A total of 18 potentially toxic benthic microalgae species were reported, including 7 dinoflagellates, 9 cyanobacteria, one diatom and one euglenophyte. The abundance of all potentially toxic microalgae varied consistently along the investigated period. Dinoflagellates dominated the microalgae assemblage in July and September 2015. Mean densities on macrophytes ranged from 33.6 cells g(-1) in May 2016 to 775.6 cells g(-1) in September 2015, being positively correlated with dissolved nitrogen-nutrients, water transparency, salinity, and chlorophyll-a. Prorocentrum cf. lima was the most frequent and abundant dinoflagellate. Overall, the highest abundance of toxic species occurred in February 2016, when cyanobacterial mats dominated by Lyngbya cf. aestuarii were observed throughout the estuary associated with periods of heavier rainfall and higher turbidity (shallower Secchi depth). At that time, a selected microphytobenthic extract exhibited acute toxicity on nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia salina in the laboratory.;[Moreira-Gonzalez, Angel Ramon| Brustolin, Marco Colossi| Mafra Junior, Luiz Laureno] Univ Fed Parana, Ctr Estudos Mar, Ponta Do Parana, PR, Brazil| [Moreira-Gonzalez, Angel Ramon] CEAC, Ctr Estudios Ambientales Cienfuegos, Cienfuegos, Cuba| [Brustolin, Marco Colossi] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland, New Zealand;Mafra, LL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Ctr Estudos Mar, Ponta Do Parana, PR, Brazil.;luiz.mafra@ufpr.br;;;International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)International Atomic Energy Agency [18827 (CRP K41014)]| CAPESCAPES| CNPq (Brazil)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| PEC-PG Program| Fundacao Araucaria (Brazil)Fundacao Araucaria;This study was supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) through the Research Contract #18827 (CRP K41014).

Six hundred laying hens were allocated based on a completely randomized design into five treatments (0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1% inclusion of D. salina biomass) with 12 replicates of 10 hens per treatment. The experiment was divided into three periods of four weeks each, totaling 84 days. During this period, the productive performance of laying hens, the physical-chemical quality of the eggs, and the morphometric alterations of the small intestine and liver were determined. The inclusion levels of D. salina biomass had a linear effect on the performance (egg weight, egg mass, and feed conversion), qualitative parameters (yolk weight and yolk index), and physicochemical parameters of eggs (total carotenoids, TBARS, and yolk color). At the same time, villi lengths and the villus:crypt ratio of the duodenum and ileum segments and the metabolization of carotenoids in the liver were increased as an effect of Dunaliella salina dietary supplementation. Thus, the inclusion of marine microalgae D. salina biomass in experimental diets for laying hens improves the performance, the intestinal health, the physical-chemical quality of the eggs, and at the same time increases carotenoid content and improves egg oxidative stability.;[Vasconcelos Fernandes, Raimunda Thyciana] Univ Fed Rural Semi Arido, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Mossoro, RN, Brazil| [Goncalves, Alex Augusto] Univ Fed Rural Semi Arido, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Lab Tecnol & Controle Qualidade Pescado, Mossoro, RN, Brazil| [Varela de Arruda, Alex Martins] Univ Fed Rural Semi Arido, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Lab Nutr Precisao, Mossoro, RN, Brazil;de Arruda, AMV (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rural Semi Arido, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Lab Nutr Precisao, Mossoro, RN, Brazil.;alexmva@ufersa.edu.br;;Arruda, Alex Martins Varela de/0000-0002-8257-8249;Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) - BrazilCAPES;The authors thank the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) - Brazil for the research grant awarded to the first author.;;38;0;0;1;1;REVISTA BRASILEIRA ZOOTECNIA BRAZILIAN JOURNAL ANIMAL SCI;VICOSA-MG;UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL VICOSA,, 36571-000 VICOSA-MG, BRAZIL;1516-3598;1806-9290;;REV BRAS ZOOTECN;Rev.

It is essential to choose the proper microalgae strain and culture condition to achieve an efficient production. The production yield of carotenoids by Dunaliella salina under the stress-induced culture conditions of nitrogen deprivation and excessive light intensity was evaluated. Also, a survey at laboratorial scale of the growth kinetics under different culture conditions of photoperiod, aeration, and agitation was performed for the seven species of green microalgae Ankistrodesmus fusiformis, Chlamydocapsa bacillus, Desmodesmus brasiliensis, Kirchneriella lunaris, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Scenedesmus obliquus. As a result, aeration of atmospheric air is enough to improve the growth kinetics of the seven species studied. Production of carotenoids was enhanced under stress by excessive light intensity. Although D. salina does not grow effectively under nitrogen deprivation, this stress condition may be used to quickly stimulate carotenoid production once the culture reaches a high cellular population.;[Almeida, Cintia Jesus| Carneiro, Diego de Carvalho| da Cunha Lima, Suzana Telles] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Salvador, BA, Brazil| [Almeida, Cintia Jesus| Sales, Emerson Andrade] Univ Fed Bahia, Escola Politecn, Salvador, BA, Brazil;Lima, STD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Salvador, BA, Brazil.;stcunhalima@ufba.br;Carneiro, Diego C./X-9798-2019| SALES, EMERSON/F-2005-2015;Carneiro, Diego C./0000-0002-2258-8197| SALES, EMERSON/0000-0002-9607-7285| da Cunha Lima, Suzana/0000-0002-9099-324X;CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior)CAPES| FAPESB (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia);The authors would like to acknowledge CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior) and FAPESB (Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia) for the support.;;21;0;0;1;1;INST TECNOLOGIA PARANA;CURITIBA-PARANA;RUA PROF ALGACYR MUNHOZ MADER 3775-CIC, 81350-010 CURITIBA-PARANA, BRAZIL;1516-8913;1678-4324;;BRAZ ARCH BIOL TECHN;Braz.

These microorganisms also accumulate high amounts of oil, which can be extracted and converted into biodiesel using chemical processes. In this work, freshwater microalgae Chlorella vulgaris was grown in the Live Food Production Laboratory (LABPAV/IFCE Aracati Campus), with urea (stock solution 1), triple superphosphate (stock solution 2) and vitamins (stock solution 3), in growth medium, in triplicate, using three different quantities of stock solutions 1 and 2, but with a constant amount of vitamins. The quantities of 0.5, 1 and 2 mL (T0.5, Ti and T2, respectively) were used for both stock solutions. We then monitored the growth of the microalgae, flocculated through chemical flocculation by adding a NaOH 2N solution, air-oven dried at 60 degrees C for 24 hours, weighed the dried biomass on a semi-analytical balance, and extracted the oil using solvents. We thus observed that algal growth intensified and dry biomass increased as the amount of nutrients increased in the growth media| inversely, the best oil level was observed in the treatment using the lowest amount of nutrients in the growth media where the microalgae developed (20.13 +/- 0.19%). Finally, in Treatment T2, even with the lowest percentage of oil (18.95%), the amount of biomass produced compensates in the oil productivity, and using a lower amount of nutrients in the media of culture.;[Araujo, Glacio Souza| Alves da Silva, Jose William] Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Ceara, IFCE, Campus Aracati,Rodovia CE 040,Km 137,1 Aeroporto, Aracati, Ceara, Brazil| [Mascena Lopes, Dilliani Naiane] Univ Fed Ceara, RENORBIO, Rede Nordeste Biotecnol, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil| [Santiago, Clarice da Silva] Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Ceara, IFCE, Engn Aquicultura, Campus Aracati, Aracati, Ceara, Brazil| [Narciso Fernandes, Fabiano Andre] Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Engn Quim, Campus Pici, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil;Araujo, GS (corresponding author), Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Ceara, IFCE, Campus Aracati,Rodovia CE 040,Km 137,1 Aeroporto, Aracati, Ceara, Brazil.;glacio@ifce.edu.br| naianemascena88@gmail.com| claricesantiaggo@gmail.com| jose.william@ifce.edu.br| fabiano@ufc.br;, 一分/AAN-8574-2020;;;;;32;0;0;0;6;UNIV FEDERAL CEARA, DEPT GEOL;FORTALEZA;CAMPUS UNIV PICI, BLOCO 912, CX POSTAL 6027, FORTALEZA, CEARA 60451-970, BRAZIL;0045-6888;1806-6690;;REV CIENC AGRON;Rev.

Most studies have used isolated microalgae species| however, this practice does not match the reality of conditions in wastewater treatment plants. Operational conditions that promote greater growth of algal biomass and that remove pollutants most effectively are disputed in the literature. In this context, LED-illuminated photobioreactors with microalgae were evaluated using multivariate analysis in order to optimize removal of pollutants (nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbonaceous organic matter). Three variables were evaluated: operating time, LED wavelength, and luminous flux intensity. A microalgae consortium was used in the photobioreactor. In addition to the LED-illuminated photobioreactors, control photobioreactors illuminated by sunlight were also operated. Using the results obtained in the optimization, a scaled-up reactor approximately 8.5 times larger in volume was operated to evaluate if the behavior would be maintained. The best operational conditions for the removal of pollutants were observed in LED-illuminated photobioreactors operated under a light intensity of 700 mu mol center dot m(-2)s(-1) for 15 days. Under these conditions, it was possible to remove 89.97% of carbonaceous organic matter, 86.50% of nitrogen, and 30.64% of phosphorus.

Hence, this paper focused on the development of a flat-plate PBR (FP-PBR) with improved fluid dynamics (FD), based on the system analysis theory, to achieve the maximum possible high-density culture (HDC). Therefore, 10-L FP-PBRs were built with and without internal bubble dispersers. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) concept based on the Euler-Euler model was applied to study the FD of FP-PBRs through the software Comsol Muliiphysics (R). The system was considered as a 2D lateral cut of the three FP-PBRA - no disperser| FP-PBRB - simple disperser| and FP-PBRC - complex disperser. The simulations indicated that in PBRB and PBRC the flashing light effect was achieved. To prove the applied strategy, real photoautotrophic experiments with Poterioochromonas malhamensis were designed and performed. Comparison between FP-PBRA and FP-PBRC performance showed a drastic improvement in microalgae growth, up to 270% in biomass concentration. Finally, the application of the system analysis theory along with CFD stands out as a unique and powerful tool for system modelling, optimization and design.;[Hinterholz, Camila Larissa| Goes Trigueros, Daniela Estelita| Modenes, Aparecido Nivaldo| Borba, Carlos Eduardo| Schuelter, Adilson Ricken] West Parana State Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Rua Fac 645, BR-85903000 Toledo, Parana, Brazil| [Kroumov, Alexander Dimitrov] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Dept Appl Microbiol, Div Microbial Synth & Ecol, Inst Microbiol Stephan Angeloff, Acad G Bonchev Str,Bl 26, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria| [Scheufele, Fabiano Bisinella] Fed Univ Technol Parana UTFPR, Grad Program Biotechnol & Bioproc Engn, Campus Toledo,Rua Cristo Rei 19, BR-85902490 Toledo, Parana, Brazil;Modenes, AN (corresponding author), West Parana State Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Rua Fac 645, BR-85903000 Toledo, Parana, Brazil.;anmodenes@yahoo.com.br;Scheufele, Fabiano Bisinella/D-7859-2017| Ricken Schuelter, Adilson/Y-9382-2018;Scheufele, Fabiano Bisinella/0000-0002-5259-2090| Ricken Schuelter, Adilson/0000-0002-5545-7601;CNPq (National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [400771/2014-4]| CAPESCAPES;The authors would like to give special thanks to CNPq (National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development) for the Special Visiting Researcher Fellowship for Alexander Dimitrov Kroumov, pH.D. and for the Post-Doctoral Fellowship for Adilson Ricken Schuelter, pH.D. through the program Science without borders under the grant #400771/2014-4, and to CAPES for the doctoral fellowship for Camila Larissa Hinterholz, M.Sc.;;60;0;0;6;6;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;1369-703X;1873-295X;;BIOCHEM ENG J;Biochem.

We also evaluated oxidative stability. Two diets containing 0 and 0.4% of microalgae Schizochytrium sp. were evaluated in three experiments. On Experiment I the palatability of diets containing 0% versus 0.4% microalgae was compared. In Experiment II test diets were offered for 30 days to determine digestibility, fecal characteristics, and blood parameters. In Experiment III, the oxidative stability of diets containing microalgae versus anchovy oil was evaluated. There was a higher intake ratio of the diet containing microalgae (p < .05). The ME and CTTAD of nutrients increased (p < .05), except for ether extract after acid hydrolysis, with the inclusion of the microalgae in diet. The amount of monocytes and phagocytic granulocytes was higher (p < .05) in dogs fed 0.4% microalgae. There was greater oxidative stability for the sample containing microalgae. The addition of 0.4% microalgae presented high palatability, increased phagocytic cell numbers, and demonstrated oxidative stability superior to anchovy oil.;[Menezes Souza, Camilla Mariane| de Lima, Daniele Cristina| Bastos, This Silvino| de Oliveira, Simone Gisele| Felix, Ananda Portella] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Anim Sci, BR-80035050 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil| [Branco Beirao, Breno Castello] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Basic Pathol, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil;Souza, CMM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Dept Anim Sci, BR-80035050 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.;camillazootec@gmail.com;Beirao, Breno/AAG-7178-2020| Souza, Camilla Mariane Menezes/AAN-7748-2020;Beirao, Breno/0000-0001-5870-1369| Souza, Camilla Mariane Menezes/0000-0003-2095-5835| Felix, Ananda/0000-0002-8570-5725| Bastos, Tais/0000-0002-7741-715X;;;;39;0;0;0;15;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1344-3941;1740-0929;;ANIM SCI J;Anim.

Lectins can be obtained from different sources, such as microalgae. Tetradesmus obliquus is a green microalga that produces bioactives with high added value. A novel lectin was purified from microalgae T. obliquus by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographies and characterized by molecular mass determination| carbohydrate contents| recognition of the rabbit, bovine, horse, and ABO blood type| inhibition by carbohydrate and glycoprotein| optimum pH and temperature| and their stability. Lectin was purified with a purification factor of 4.2-fold and yield of 3.13 in a two-step using ion exchange and gel filtration. It agglutinated human type O and rabbit erythrocytes but not bovine, horse, human erythrocytes types A1, A2, B, and AB. Lectin showed optimum pH at 7.0-7.5 and stability for 90 min, while the optimum temperature of 20-50 degrees C showed fairly good thermostability. The lectin is a glycoprotein with 5.37% of carbohydrate, an apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa as determined by gel filtration, and the activity was decreasing in the presence of ions and inhibited only by glycoprotein azoalbumin, azocasein, and albumin, characteristics that indicate the lectin from T. obliquus as unique among microalgal lectins.;[Silva, A.

Flocculation is a promising technology, but the dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by microalgae during growth interacts with the flocculant, hindering the process. This DOM is composed mostly of proteins and carbohydrates which may present a polarity ranging from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. In aquaculture, foam fractionators are routinely employed to remove DOM from cultures, improving the water quality. However, this equipment has never been employed in microalgae cultures. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the use of the foam fractionator to remove DOM from a Nannochloropsis oceanica culture to improve the flocculation process. First, DOM accumulation was monitored for 33 days in a 330 L outdoor culture to characterize the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and protein and carbohydrate contents. Samples from logarithmic (day 13) and stationary (day 29) growth phases were fractionated by polarity (hydrophobic, transphilic, and hydrophilic), the DOC and protein and carbohydrate contents of each fraction were measured, and flocculation was performed. Then the culture was treated with a foam fractionator at bench (11 L) and pilot scales (1600 L), and the composition and flocculation were compared with the non-treated culture. Proteins strongly hindered flocculation, and the foam fractionator was effective in removing this element and significantly improved the flocculation efficiency. Furthermore, N. oceanica cell integrity was not affected by the foam fractionator. These results indicate that DOM can be efficiently removed by foam fractionation, improving the microalgae harvesting process.;[Roselet, Milene| Roselet, Fabio| Abreu, Paulo Cesar] Fundacao Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Lab Microalgae Prod, Av Italia,Km 8, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil;Roselet, M (corresponding author), Fundacao Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Lab Microalgae Prod, Av Italia,Km 8, BR-96201900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.;mileneroselet@icloud.com;Abreu, Paulo Cesar/A-5145-2013| Roselet, Fabio/S-6421-2016;Abreu, Paulo Cesar/0000-0002-7657-1112| Roselet, Fabio/0000-0002-1428-664X;Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)CAPES [1647027, 150531/2016-8];M.

The protein per biomass percentage of seven species of Chlorophyceae microalgae was estimated by a procedure that includes a protein precipitation step for removal of interfering substances. Ankistrodesmus fusiformis, Coelastrum microporum and Scenedesmus obliquus presented the highest protein content (22%, 21%, and 25%, respectively), whereas Chlamydocapsa bacillus presented the lowest protein per biomass ratio (11%). Specific values of percent extinction coefficients (E1%) for each strain was used as a strategy for rapid estimations of total protein concentrations from microalgae by absorbance readings at 280nm. The species found with the highest lectin contents were Kirchneriella lunaris, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and C. bacillus, since they rendered the highest specific hemagglutinating activity (SHA) values for their total protein precipitates (5.2, 3.5, and 2.3, respectively), which was defined as the ratio between the hemagglutinating activity titer and the logarithm of its total protein concentration in mu g/mL. Because the titer is indirectly associated to the concentration of lectins in a sample before the serial dilution, the SHA is more convenient for screening of different species, as it also includes the protein concentration of the titer.;[Carneiro, Diego de Carvalho| Oliveira, Mariane Mascarenhas| da Cunha Lima, Suzana Telles] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Rua Barao de Jeremoabo 147, BR-40170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil;Carneiro, DC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Rua Barao de Jeremoabo 147, BR-40170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil.;diegoccarneiro@gmail.com;Carneiro, Diego C./X-9798-2019;Carneiro, Diego C./0000-0002-2258-8197| da Cunha Lima, Suzana/0000-0002-9099-324X;Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia (FAPESB);The authors would like to acknowledge Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia (FAPESB) for their support.;;32;0;2;0;14;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;2585-7290;1336-9075;;CHEM PAP;Chem.

The highest value was reached when the concentrations of soy lecithin and lipase were taken at their lowest and highest levels, respectively.

In this context, the green microalgae Chlamydomonas sp. was submitted for 3days to the absence of nutrients. Thus, the efficacy of the extraction of the crude hexane lipid fraction (CHF), using mechanical stirred associated with ultrasound technique, was evaluated in two different times (2 and 4h), using scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). Saponifiable fractions, CHF extracts and crude chloroform fraction (CCF) were esterified and characterized by TG, FTIR and GC/MS to identify their fatty profile. Residual biomass (RB) was analyzed by elemental analysis, and the resulting data were employed to estimate the higher heating value (HHV) and crude protein percentage. The micrographs of the biomass surfaces before and after the extraction process showed significant fragmentation only for the time of 4h. A pronounced mass loss in the typical lipid range was evidenced by TG being consistent with the significant difference of material extracted in the time of 2h (2.95 +/- 0.28)% and 4h (10.54 +/- 0.46)%. The total lipid fraction (CHF and CCF) was approximately 29%. The RB revealed values of HHV and crude protein of 18MJkg(-1) and 56%, respectively. The TG data for the CCF extract revealed a material consisting mainly of saponifiable fractions, unlike CHF which is composed predominantly of unsaponifiables. Therefore, the TG curve ratified a better conversion rate to CCF (approximately 89%), consistent with the value obtained by GC/MS (about 86%). The fatty profile for the saponifiable fractions of both extracts showed that the major fatty acids are C16:0 and C18:3 (omega-3 and omega-6). The ester profile with elevated concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (C18:3) is unfeasible in their application for biodiesel production| nevertheless, the fatty profile of microalgae suggests pharmacological potential for diet or therapy, since some of the main components are reported as bioactive metabolites.;[Gomes, Anderson F.| Costa, Marta| de Carvalho, Luciene S.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Inst Chem, BR-59078970 Natal, RN, Brazil| [Bicudo, Tatiana de C.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Sci & Technol Sch, BR-59078970 Natal, RN, Brazil| [Di Souza, Luiz] Univ State Rio Grande Norte, FANAT, Chem Dept, Catalysis Lab Environm & Mat LACAM, BR-59620676 Mossoro, RN, Brazil;Gomes, AF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Inst Chem, BR-59078970 Natal, RN, Brazil.;gomesfisica007@hotmail.com;de Carvalho, Luciene Santos/G-7588-2019;de Carvalho, Luciene Santos/0000-0002-8047-8471| Bicudo, Tatiana/0000-0002-4362-3676;;;;69;0;0;1;9;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1388-6150;1588-2926;;J THERM ANAL CALORIM;J.

Water quality in all aquariums was adequate for the growth of Xiphophorus maculatus, whilst pH acidity in inert diet (ID) treatment and high content of P in AAC diet treatment did not interfere in fish development. Growth performance parameters were higher (P<0.05) in ALM diet treatment, except condition factor and feed conversion ratio, with similar rates (P>0.05) in all diet treatments. Survival was above 75% and total length was similar (P>0.05) for ID and AAC diet treatments. Lipid levels ranged between 7 and 11%, and was enough to maintain high survival rates (>80%) and weight gain above 0.42g to mixed diet (AAC and ALM) and 0.27g to inert diet.

The microalgae biomass was mainly composed by (%): carbohydrates (41 +/- 0.4), proteins (50 +/- 0.4), and lipids (1.3 +/- 0.5). The residual sugar present in the biomass was extracted via acid hydrolysis. Among different concentrations of sulfuric acid tested (i.e., 47, 94, 188, 281 and 563 mM), significantly higher sugar content was obtained with 188 mM (0.496 g-sugar g(-1) microalgae-DW). The concentration of sugar present in the microalgae did not differ significantly between the biomasses harvested by either centrifugation or coagulation-flocculation. Two commercially available strains of yeast (i.e., Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. cerevisiae chardonnay) were tested for their capability to ferment sugar from lyophilized microalgae biomass. S. cerevisiae chardonnay showed a significantly faster consumption of sugar during the exponential growth phase. Both strains of yeast were capable of consuming most of the sugar added congruent to 8 g L-1 within 24 h. Overall, the results suggest that carbohydrate-rich microalgae biomass obtained from the phycoremediation of swine wastewaters can play an important role in green design for industries seeking alternative sources of feedstock rich in sugar.;[Michelon, William| Pirolli, Mateus| Soares, Hugo Moreira] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, BR-88040700 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil| [Michelon, William] Victor Sopelsa 3000, BR-89711330 Concordia, SC, Brazil| [Mezzari, Melissa Paola] Baylor Coll Med, Alkek Ctr Methagen & Microbiome Res, One Baylor Plaza,MS BMC 385 RM 808EC, Houston, TX 77005 USA| [da Silva, Marcio Luis Busi] Rice Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA;Michelon, W (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, BR-88040700 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.| Michelon, W (corresponding author), Victor Sopelsa 3000, BR-89711330 Concordia, SC, Brazil.;william@unc.br;William, Michelon/AAV-1534-2020;Moreira Soares, Hugo/0000-0001-9666-7632| Michelon, William/0000-0003-0713-0150;Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) [02.12.08. 004.00.05]| CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of BrazilCAPES;This research was supported by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) grant no. 02.12.08. 004.00.05 and CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of Brazil.;;58;0;0;2;7;IWA PUBLISHING;LONDON;ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND;0273-1223;1996-9732;;WATER SCI TECHNOL;Water Sci.

However, the lipid extraction from the algal biomass stands as a challenge due to its low yields and cost-intensive cell disruption procedures. In this study a multivariate optimization of the extraction conditions was suggested, aiming a maximization of the lipid extraction from Scenedesmus sp. microalgae grown using wastewater as a nutrient medium. The extraction method, extraction time, solvent mixture and pretreatment were considered between upper and lower levels in order to access their significance, including their interactions, on the experimental response, while using a reduced number of experiments. The studies were performed using low-cost extraction methods (magnetic stirring and ultrasonication). The optimal extraction condition was obtained using CHCl3:MeOH (2:1) solvent mixture, in a 2-hour extraction period using ultrasonication. Fatty acid profiles of extracted lipids were also evaluated.;[Dall'Oglio, Daiane F.| de Sousa, Laisse C.| de Sousa, Samuel A. A.| Garcia, Marco A.

These processes can decrease proliferation rates and they are well known for bacteria, fungi, and animals, but there is a lack of knowledge regarding autotrophic cells. Carbohydrates and proteins (e.g., lectins) are important molecules for cell interactions and information about these molecules is essential to better understand many biological phenomena in uni- or multicellular organisms. Most studies focus on the identification of the carbohydrates present on the cell surface by using labeled lectins. Alternatively, here we present a pioneer research performed by using three different labeled carbohydrates in a multivalent presentation (glycodendrons) to detect the presence of carbohydrate receptors (e.g., lectins) on cell surfaces of 12 algal species. The goal of this study was to detect some specificity in these molecular interactions, but in a reverse way in comparison to that commonly described in the literature. We tested trivalent molecules containing residuals of D-mannose, L-fucose, or N-acetyl-galactosamine to identify their bindings with the corresponding lectins expressed on cell surfaces. We envisage that our new approach could be an alternative tool for taxonomic and physiological studies on microalgae or even on other groups of organisms. Based on our results, the receptors found in the cell surface of the algal species tend to differ in composition, quantity, and distribution. The differences were mainly species-specific, since no patterns were identified at higher taxonomic level. Moreover, like lectins, labeled carbohydrates were proved to be a reliable tool for the study of cell surface composition.;[Goncalves, Cintia de Almeida| Giani, Alessandra| Figueredo, Cleber Cunha] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Bot, Inst Ciencias Biol, Ave Antonio Carlos,6627,Caixa Postal 486, BR-31970901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil| [Figueiredo, Rute Cunha] Univ Fed Ouro Preto, Inst Ciencias Exatas & Biol, Dept Quim, R Diogo Vasconcelos 122, BR-35400000 Pilar, Ouro Preto, Brazil| [Collado, Daniel| Perez-Inestrosa, Ezequiel] Univ Malaga, Dept Quim Organ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain| [Collado, Daniel| Perez-Inestrosa, Ezequiel] Ctr Nanomed & Biotecnol BIONAND, Parque Tecnol Andalucia, Malaga 29590, Spain| [Rojo, Javier] Univ Seville, CSIC, Inst Invest Quim IIQ, Glycosyst Lab, Seville 41092, Spain;Figueredo, CC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Bot, Inst Ciencias Biol, Ave Antonio Carlos,6627,Caixa Postal 486, BR-31970901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.;cleberfigueredo@ufmg.br;Giani, Alessandra/H-9764-2012;Giani, Alessandra/0000-0002-2524-8534| Figueredo, Cleber/0000-0002-6248-1327;Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)Minas Gerais State Research Foundation (FAPEMIG)| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)CAPES| Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq-CsF)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)| Fundacion Carolina| Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO) of Spain [CTQ2014-52328-P]| European Regional Development Funds (ERDF)European Union (EU);C.C.F. and R.C.F. thank Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) for financial support.

At 7, 21 and 35 days of age, the birds were weighed for performance evaluation (live weight, weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion and mortality). At 35 days of age, one chicken per experimental unit was sacrificed for evaluation of carcass yield and its parts, together with isolation of the left thigh for analysis of the fatty acid profile. The inclusion of seaweed in the diet did not alter the characteristics of performance or yield in carcass and organs| however, the supplement changed the profile of fatty acids of the meat, enriching the omega-3 series, primarily DHA.

Drying costs of microalgae biomass are still high and they should be reduced for the production of compounds with low added value. Therefore, we evaluated the drying process of the microalga Scenedesmus obliquus BR003 using low temperatures. S. obliquus BR003 is a robust microalga that shows high lipid productivity. At laboratory scale, it was observed that the biomass of S. obliquus BR003 was rapidly dried at low temperatures between 50 and 60 degrees C. A gas dryer was used to evaluate the drying of the biomass of S. obliquus BR003 on a pilot-scale. The biomass was dried in less than 24 h using the gas dryer| however, the high moisture of the microalga biomass required a higher air renovation in the drying chamber. Computational fluid dynamics analysis of the gas dryer showed two important parameters to achieve greater effectiveness of heat and mass transfer rates during the drying process of the microalga biomass. It was concluded that a gas dryer suitable for the microalgae biomass should have multiple air injection points, and an efficient circulation and renovation system of air inside the drying chamber.;[de Melo Aguiar, Andry Caroline| Martins, Marcio Bides| Barbosa, Ruben Christian| Bustos-Vanegas, Jaime Daniel| Soares, Jimmy| Leite, Mauricio de Oliveira| Rocha, Dilson Novais| Comes, Arthur Freitas| Bechara, Gabriela de Castro] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Engn Agr, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil;Martins, MB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Engn Agr, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.;aredes@ufv.br;Soares, Jimmy/L-2493-2018| Martins, Marcio/C-1105-2017;Soares, Jimmy/0000-0003-3452-3275| Martins, Marcio/0000-0001-5705-9431;Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [307147/2015-0, 140609/2016-4]| FAPEMIGMinas Gerais State Research Foundation (FAPEMIG) [APQ-01357-14]| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES)CAPES [001];We are thankful to Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, grants 307147/2015-0 and 140609/2016-4) and FAPEMIG (APQ-01357-14) for the scholarships.

We also addressed whether it is possible to choose a strain suitable for growing in each season of a given region. A factorial experiment revealed a significant interaction between chlorophylls a and b (Chl a and Chl b), carotenoid/Chl (a + b) ratio, biomass and total lipid productivity of six green microalgae (four Chlorella spp., Chlorella sorokiniana and Neochloris oleoabundans) after 15 days at four temperatures. At 39/35 A degrees C, two Chlorella sp. strains (IPR7115 and IPR7117) showed higher total carotenoids/Chl (a + b) (0.578 and 0.830), respectively. N. oleoabundans had the highest Chl a (8210 mu g L-1) and Chl b (1909 mu g L-1) at 19/15 A degrees C and highest maximum dry biomass (2900 mg L-1), specific growth rate (0.538 day(-1)) and total lipids (1003 mg L-1) at 15/8 A degrees C. We applied a method to infer the growth of these six green microalgae in outdoor ponds, as based on their response to changing temperatures and by combining with historical data on day/night air temperature occurrence for a given region. We conclude that the use of regionalized maps based on air temperature is a good strategy for predicting microalgal cultivation in outdoor ponds based on their features and tolerance to changing temperature.;[Maroubo, Lucas Alves] Univ Estadual Londrina, Programa Posgrad Bioenergia, Ctr Ciencias Exatas, Rodovia Celso Garcia Cid,Km 320,POB 6001, Londrina, Parana, Brazil| [Maroubo, Lucas Alves| Andrade, Diva S.| Caviglione, Joao Henrique| Lovato, Gisele Milani| Nagashima, Getulio Takashi] Inst Agron Parana IAPAR, Rodovia Celso Garcia Cid,Km 375,POB 10030, BR-86047902 Londrina, Parana, Brazil;Andrade, DS (corresponding author), Inst Agron Parana IAPAR, Rodovia Celso Garcia Cid,Km 375,POB 10030, BR-86047902 Londrina, Parana, Brazil.;2013divaandrade@gmail.com;Andrade, Diva/N-1281-2015| Maroubo, Lucas/N-1766-2014;Andrade, Diva/0000-0003-0761-004X| Maroubo, Lucas/0000-0002-4655-2877;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico (CNPq) project [407297/2013-8];The study was partially supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico (CNPq) project (407297/2013-8).;;55;0;0;1;11;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1939-1234;1939-1242;;BIOENERG RES;BioEnergy Res.;DEC;2018;11;4;;;;;748;762;;10.1007/s12155-018-9931-2;;;15;Energy & Fuels| Environmental Sciences;Energy & Fuels| Environmental Sciences & Ecology;HB0ET;WOS:000450685700002;;;;;2021-01-01

However, the high free fatty acids content of the oil hinders the oil refining by conventional processes. The aim of this study was to separate neutral lipids in high acidity oils, such as microalgae, by determining the equilibrium data of the extraction system including triacylglycerol, free fatty acids, hexane, and hydrous ethanol (95%). Because the microalgae oil has a complex composition, a model oil blend analogous infatty acid composition to Desmodesmus communis oil was used. Experimental equilibrium curves (binodal) and tie-line composition were determined for oil blends with 2, 20, and 40% of FFA at 308.2, 313.2, and 318.2 K. Three empirical equations were used to correlate binodal data. The parameters of the equation with the best fit were used along with the phase separation data, which were obtained by gravimetric method, for the construction of the tie lines. The consistency of experimental tie-line data was checked by using the Othmer-Tobias and Bancroft equations. Neutral lipids distribution coefficient and FFA distribution coefficient, as well as the selectivity of hydrous ethanol, were calculated for all systems.;[Barcelos, Tamires Teixeira| Martins, Marcio] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Agr Engn, Ave PH Rolfs S-N, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil| [Sousa, Rita] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Chem, Ave PH Rolfs S-N, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil| [dos Reis Coimbra, Jane Selia] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Food Technol, Ave PH Rolfs S-N, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil;Sousa, R (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Chem, Ave PH Rolfs S-N, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.;rita.sousa@ufv.br;Coimbra, Jane/Y-4249-2019| Martins, Marcio/C-1105-2017| Martins, Marcio/M-4671-2019;Coimbra, Jane/0000-0002-5998-189X| Martins, Marcio/0000-0001-5705-9431| Martins, Marcio/0000-0001-5705-9431;CAPESCAPES| CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [307147/2015-0]| FAPEMIGMinas Gerais State Research Foundation (FAPEMIG) [APQ-01357-14]| Petrobras - Petroleo Brasileiro S/A [2016/00193-1];The authors thank CAPES, CNPq (307147/2015-0), FAPEMIG (APQ-01357-14) and Petrobras - Petroleo Brasileiro S/A (2016/00193-1) for providing research funding and scholarship.;;42;0;0;2;19;AMER CHEMICAL SOC;WASHINGTON;1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA;0021-9568;;;J CHEM ENG DATA;J.

Auxins play a crucial role in the growth and development of higher plants and are also used as herbicides or germination inhibitors. The aim of this work was to study the effects of a fresh water microalga on the germination and developing of Arabidopsis thaliana. Axenic liquid cultures of Chlorella sorokiniana were grown and used to prepare different types of solid agar-based media on which Arabidopsis was sowed. Germination was completely inhibited on the medium containing cells subjected to a treatment of mechanical lysis and on the medium with intact cells. GC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of free indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in both liquid growing medium and cells. These results indicated that these microalgae produce free IAA at sufficient concentration to affect the seedlings development acting as herbicide.;[Fierli, D.| Reyes, T.

The knowledge of these organisms that inhabit epicontinental waters in Brazil is extremely heterogeneous in relation to the geographic region and the taxonomic group. Taxonomically there is much more knowledge about the algae of the South and Southeast regions of the country than there is about the algae of the North and Central-West regions. Therefore, this research presents a revised and updated knowledge of the algae that occur in the National Park of the Chapada dos Guimaraes (PNCG) and surrounding areas. Our area of study is located in the state of Mato Grosso, in the center-west region of Brazil. The database was obtained from published literature related to taxonomic and ecological inventories, as well as new collections carried out in the area. The collection methods were quite diverse to cover all types of organisms, in plankton, periphyton, filamentous masses, sludge and water accumulated in bromeliads, the new collections are samples collected exclusively in the plankton. They were listed 182 taxa, distributed in 83 genera, 45 families, 11 classes and seven taxonomic divisions. In total, 89 taxa were found in the new samplings, of which nine taxa were already registered in the existing literature, so 80 taxa are new records for the region. A large number of taxa previously mentioned in the literature were not recorded in the sampled environments, most of them composed of Bacillariophyceae, Conjugatophyceae and Euglenophyceae. As well as three species of cyanobacteria of great sanitary importance were registered. Therefore, CGNP has great importance in the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity and to know this community becomes increasingly important to support management measures.;[Pereira Assis, Gisele Fernanda| da Silva, Samiris Pereira| de Siqueira Silva, Ludmylla Fernanda| da Costa, Regiane Luiza| de Oliveira, Marcia Teixeira] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Av Fernando Correa Costa, BR-78060900 Cuiaba, MT, Brazil| [da Fonseca, Luany Weiler| De-Lamonica-Freire, Ermelinda Maria] Ctr Univ Varzea Grande, Av Dom Orlando Chaves 2655, BR-78118000 Varzea Grande, MT, Brazil| [de Figueiredo, Daniela Maimoni] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Programa Posgrad Recursos Hidr, Av Fernando Correa Costa, BR-78060900 Cuiaba, MT, Brazil;Assis, GFP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Av Fernando Correa Costa, BR-78060900 Cuiaba, MT, Brazil.;gisele.fernanda2@gmail.com;;;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico- CNPq through the project: Rede Pro Centro-Oeste-REMISA (Projeto CNPq) [564617/2010-5]| Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Mato Grosso- FAPEMAT through the project: Rede Pro Centro-Oeste-REMISA (Projeto FAPEMAT) [232949/2011]| Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-CAPESCAPES;We thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico- CNPq and the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Mato Grosso- FAPEMAT for financial support through the projects: Rede Pro Centro-Oeste-REMISA (Projeto CNPq no 564617/2010-5 and Projeto FAPEMAT no 232949/2011), coordinated by Eliana Freire Gaspar de Carvalho Dores, and Rede ComCerrado/Nucleo UFMT, processo no 563134/2010.

The research was carried out from the association of codes of the International Classification of Patents with keywords on the subject, in the database Espacenet, resulting in 70 patents. The information found was compiled in graphs and discussed. The use of this technology was evidenced mainly in China, since Brazil has no tradition in the consumption of snacks and still looks for resources regarding innovation. Brazil does not have patents associated with the production of snacks. The raw material most used was wheat flour, following the sprinkle. The patent deposit began in the 1980s and has been growing.

Lipids represent an important source of raw material for obtaining biofuels, such as biodiesel. One of the processes for the production of cost-effective lipids is extraction via solvents, using chloroform and methanol. In order to obtain the highest lipid yield per gram of biomass, lipids were extracted from Chlorella minutissima biomass and a Taguchi orthogonal array was applied, with simultaneous study of four factors that influence at this process: biomass moisture, solvent ratio, total volume of solvents and ultrasound time to potentiate breakdown cell wall, facilitating release of lipids. 20% lipid content was obtained by employing 64% wet biomass, a ratio of 5.7 chloroform: 3 methanol: 1 water, 33 mL total volume and 70 minutes ultrasound time. Lipids were converted to biodiesel by transesterification via acid catalysis, obtaining 94.45% conversion.;[Zorn, S. M. F. E.| Pedro, G. A.| Amaral, M. S.| Silva, M.

The cultivation was carried out in reactors with a total volume of 3 L and 0.7 vvm aeration, with illumination in photoperiods of 12 h light/12 h dark for 12 days. The following sugar concentrations were tested: 2.5, 5.0 and 10 g/L of glucose, lactose, fructose and galactose with 10% inoculum volume. After experiments were performed with cheese whey in natura and cheese whey permeate with different lactose concentrations (1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 5.0 g/L). In these experiments the inoculum concentrations were 10, 15, 20 and 30% (v/v). The results showed that this microalga was effective for the production of lipids when it was cultivated in medium with cheese whey in natura with 2.5 g/L of lactose and 20% inoculum (v/v). Using cheese whey in natura at the concentration of 3.5 g/L of lactose and 30% (v/v) of inoculum obtained 77.9% of TOC removal and 38.447 mg of TOC removed/mg oil produced. It was also observed that when there is increased production of bio-oil, there is less removal of organic matter. The addition of glucose, fructose or galactose in the medium did not enhance the production of bio-oil by Scenedesmus sp. when compared to lactose, but increased the organic matter removal.

Information on filter feeding, their main process of energy acquisition, are relevant and still scarce for tropical regions. The rotifers of the class Bdelloidea feed by filtration or scraping consuming small food items, such as bacteria, algae, yeasts or particulate organic matter. We know little of their role in the trophic dynamics in the habitats they occupy and so the aim of this study was to quantify laboratory filtration and ingestion rates of the rotifer Philodina roseola, fed with Raphidocelis subcapitata. The experiment consisted of 10 adult exposure treatment at five concentrations approximately in the range between 104 and 107 cells mL(-1), at the temperature of 25 +/- 1 degrees C. The experiments lasted one hour and initial and final concentrations of the algal suspensions were determined by counting the number of cells in a Neubauer chamber. There were no significant differences between the initial and final concentrations of cells in the control group indicating that algal growth did not occur. Philodina roseola filtration rates varied between 0.09 and 0.25 mL ind(-1) h(-1). Given that filtration is the main process of energy acquisition by Philodina roseola, as well as for most other rotifers, and that it comprises important issues related to trophic dynamics of aquatic ecosystems, additional experimental information is especially important and need to be extended to other types of food and combinations of experimental conditions.;[Moreira, Raquel Aparecida| Mansano, Adrislaine da Silva| Rocha, Odete] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Ecol & Biol Evolut, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Recursos Nat, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil;Moreira, RA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Ecol & Biol Evolut, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Recursos Nat, Rodovia Washington Luis,Km 235, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.;raquel.moreira87@yahoo.com.br;Mansano, Adrislaine/D-1188-2017| Moreira, Raquel/AAX-5117-2020| Moreira, Raquel Aparecida/K-5258-2014;Mansano, Adrislaine/0000-0002-3118-4960| Moreira, Raquel Aparecida/0000-0001-9392-8067;;;;70;0;0;1;11;UNIV NAC COLOMBIA, FAC CIENCIAS, DEPT BIOL;BOGOTA;APARTADO AEREO 14490, BOGOTA, 00000, COLOMBIA;1900-1649;;;ACTA BIOL COLOMB;Acta Biol.

However, there are some processes of its production which need further study, such as the cultivation inputs. A possibility for an alternative raw material is the effluent from superintensive shrimp cultivation with bioflocs (BF). Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the productivity and nutrient removal rate of Nannochloropsis oculata cultivation in three systems: (i) f/2 - produced integrally with chemical fertilizers, (ii) BF - using 100% of the effluent for superintensive shrimp cultivation with bioflocs and (iii) 50/50 - using 50% of shrimp cultivation effluents and 50% from f/2 system. The microalgae presented greater biomass growth and productitvity in BF system but less lipids and esters accumulation. Concerning nutrient removal, f/2 system showed better performance, which may indicate that the cultivation in BF systems takes longer to reach the stationary growth phase.;[Galindro, Bruno Menezes] Inst Fed Santa Catarina, Rua Adriano Kormann,510 Bela Vista, BR-89110000 Gaspar, SC, Brazil| [Lopes, Rafael Garcia| Derner, Roberto Bianchini| Soares, Sebastiao Roberto] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Campus Univ,Caixa Postal 476, BR-88040970 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil;Galindro, BM (corresponding author), Inst Fed Santa Catarina, Rua Adriano Kormann,510 Bela Vista, BR-89110000 Gaspar, SC, Brazil.;bruno.menezes@ifsc.edu.br| rafael.lopes@ufsc.br| roberto.derner@ufsc.br| sr.soares@ufsc.br;Derner, Roberto Bianchini/F-1766-2015| Lopes, Rafael/M-5426-2019;Derner, Roberto Bianchini/0000-0001-6474-1287| Lopes, Rafael/0000-0001-7393-1824;Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina;This research Project would not have been possible without the support of Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, especially the researchers from Laboratorio de Cultivo de Algas and Laboratorio de Camaroes Marinhos.

It is also used as food in aquaculture for larval fish and crustaceans due to its high nutritional value and compatible size with the larvae feeding. This study evaluated the lipid content in the biomass of N. oculata under nitrate depletion. The cultivation was carried out in 8 L bottles with three replications, at salinity 27, illuminance of 60 mu E cm(-2) s(-1) and temperature 28 degrees C. The levels of sodium nitrate used were 15| 30| 45| 60 and 75 mg L-1, while maintaining constant the levels of all other nutrients of the Guillard f/2 medium. The growth curve was monitored every two days by spectrophotometry at 680 nm (DO680nm) and cell counting in a Neubauer chamber. For separation of the culture medium from the cells, we used chemical flocculation method, adding 2N NaOH.
